      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is a vast deal talked in the present day about Freewill. We
      like to feel that we are independent agents and are ready to
      overlook the fact that our surroundings and circumstances and the
      hundred and one subtle and mysterious workings of the fate we can
      none of us escape, control our actions and are responsible for
      our movements, and make us to a great extent what we are.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man is not even a free agent when he takes the most important
      step of his whole life, and marries a wife. He is impelled to it
      by considerations outside of himself; it affects not only his own
      present and future, but that of others, very often, and he must
      be guided accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emerson says; "The soul has inalienable rights, and the first of
      these is love," but he does not say marriage. Love is the
      business of the idle and the idleness of the busy, but marriage
      is quite another affair&mdash;a grave matter, and not to be
      undertaken lightly, since it is the one step that can never be
      retraced, save through the unsavoury channels of shame and
      notoriety, or death itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But perhaps Jack Chetwynd was hampered with fewer restraining
      influences than most men, for he was alone in the world, without
      kith or kin, and might be fairly allowed to please himself, and
      pleasing himself in this case meant leading to the altar, or
      rather to the Registry Office, Miss Bella Blackall, music-hall
      singer and step dancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unquestionably a case of love at first sight. The girl was
      barely seventeen, and her girlishness attracted him quite as much
      as her beauty, which was exceptional. There was nothing
      meretricious about it, for as yet she owed nothing to
      art&mdash;brown hair, warm lips, soft blue eyes, and a complexion
      like the leaf of a white rose&mdash;a woman blossom. Then, too,
      she was a happy creature, full of life and happiness and bubbling
      over with childish merriment&mdash;no one could help liking her,
      he told himself, but it was something warmer than that. What
      makes the difference between liking and love? It is so little and
      yet so much. There was an air of refinement about her, too, which
      to his fancy seemed to protest against the vulgarities of her
      surroundings. He thought he could discern the stuff that meant an
      actress in her, and prophesied that she would before long be
      playing Juliet at the Haymarket. He was still at the age when the
      habit is to discover geniuses in unlikely places, especially when
      the women are pretty. He raved about her when he adjourned with
      his companions to the bar, and they chaffed him a good deal to
      his face and sneered at him behind his back. He was there the
      next night, and the night, after and by-and-by he managed to get
      introduced to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was prettier off the stage than on, and her manner was
      charming, and her voice delicious with its racy accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was an American, and had been in London only a few months;
      and he was duly taken to a second-rate lodging in a side street
      near the Waterloo Road, and presented to "Ma,"&mdash;a black
      satined and beaded type of the race. There was also a sister,
      whom, truth to tell, he objected to more than her maternal
      relative, for she was distinctly professional, not to say loud,
      and the little mannerisms which were so taking in his inamorata
      were very much the reverse in Miss Saidie Blackall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, he told himself, he was not going to marry the whole
      family; which might be true in a sense and yet might not mean the
      entire independence it implied. Bella's relations must, if he
      made her his wife, mean more or less to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, youth is sanguine, and Jack Chetwynd did not look too
      closely at the thorns which hedged his dainty rose-bud round. She
      at least was all he could wish her to be&mdash;unsophisticated as
      a child, and pure and good at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a month's acquaintance it began to be understood that he
      was engaged to her. "Ma" wept copious tears, and reckoned her
      Bella was a lucky girl to get such an "elegant" husband; and
      Saidie wished him happiness in a voice like a corn-crake, and
      declared that her sister was "just the sweetest and best girl out
      of N'York," which she was; "and born to lead a private life,"
      which she wasn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella herself had very little to say. She blushed rosily when
      Jack made fervent love to her; acquiesced confusedly when he told
      her she must give up the music-hall stage, and seemed to take
      happily to the idea of a quiet, uneventful life as Mrs. Jack
      Chetwynd.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took a small house in Camberwell New Road. Jack put up a
      brass plate with his name on it, and M.D. in imposing letters,
      and invested in a telephone for the accommodation of night
      callers; and Bella began to busy herself about the furnishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a delightful time. The little bride elect was so excited
      and eager, and showed herself wonderfully capable, and with quite
      a pretty taste in draping and ornamenting; but there was a
      terrible hole in Jack's purse: chairs and tables seemed to cost a
      mint of money; and the young man sighed and hoped fervently that
      it would not be long before patients appeared, or he would be
      obliged to say No to his darling when she turned her appealing
      eyes upon him and begged him to give her money for that "duck of
      a screen," or something else that was from her point of view the
      most extraordinary bargain, but which, Jack reflected, privately,
      they could very well have done without.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was giving up a certainty in settling in Camberwell, for as
      House Surgeon at St. Mark's his income was assured; but then as a
      married man he could no longer have lived at the hospital, and
      "one must risk something" said Jack, hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were married in May, just three months from that eventful
      night when our hero first saw pretty Bella Blackall, on the
      boards at the "Band Box," and Mrs. John Chetwynd was altogether
      so sweet and winsome in her simple white gown, that Saidie was
      right when she hilariously remarked that Jack might well be
      forgiven for falling in love with her "all over again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding was just as quiet as it could be, for Jack did not
      care to invite any of his friends. "Ma" and Saidie were
      altogether too impossible; and unfortunately no one seemed to
      mind whether he did or not. There was one unpleasantness
      connected with the day which Chetwynd felt Bella might have had
      tact enough to avoid. Two or three of Saidie's friends, in light
      and eminently professional attire, were of the party, the women a
      good deal worse than the men; and they all returned together to
      Holly Street, where a meal had been prepared in the front
      parlours, the landlady having generously placed them at the
      disposal of her lodgers for the occasion. There was a good deal
      of banter and side jokes were bandied about from one to another;
      which was galling to young Chetwynd, and made him devoutly
      thankful that none of his own companions and friends were
      present. When at last Bella rose from the table to change her
      gown for the pale grey he himself had chosen, with the big hat
      and nodding plumes in which she had looked such a dainty little
      mortal, he pushed his chair back with a look of disgust on his
      face and left them to talk amongst themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saidie was distributing small pieces of wedding cake, laughing
      and screaming at the top of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saikes, man! you are not to eat it. Put it under your pillow and
      as sure as I'm a Yank you'll see your intended," she cried. And
      then followed an amount of vulgar chaff and coarse pleasantry
      which caused the "happy man" to set his teeth hard and register a
      vow at the bottom of his heart that this should be the last
      occasion on which his wife should associate with her sister's
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Bella came tripping down the narrow staircase, her
      cheeks warm with a pale pink colour that made her inexpressibly
      lovely; and the carriage which Mrs. Blackall had insisted upon
      ordering to take the young couple to the station was at the door,
      and in the bustle that ensued Jack lost sight of all annoyances
      and remembered only that he had married the girl he loved and
      that he was the happiest fellow in the universe; and amid a
      shower of rice and a white satin slipper (one of Saidie's), which
      fell right into Bella's lap; the last farewell was spoken, and
      they drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only to Brighton!" cried Nina Nankin, the celebrity famed for
      the height to which she could raise one leg while standing upon
      the other. "What a mean chap! He might have forked out enough for
      a trip to Paris, I should have thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wouldn't satisfy me," returned Saidie, turning up her nose
      disdainfully; "but he isn't my style, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bit of a prig, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Saidie nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do detest a man who fancies himself a head and shoulders above
      the rest of his kind," said that young lady vehemently; "you'll
      generally find out he don't amount to a row of pins. My! ain't I
      glad I'm not going to live with him. I would as lief go to
      Bible-class every day of the week. I'll bet my bottom dollar
      Bella'll see the mistake she's made before she's many weeks
      older. There's a chip of the old block about that young woman,
      for all her baby ways and her innocent know-nothing. He'll be a
      spry man, will Dr. Chetwynd, to come up to her. It'll take him
      all he knows to get ahead, you bet".
    </p>
    <p>
      Saidie lay back in the chair and laughed till the tears ran down
      her cheeks.
    </p>
    <h2 class="chp">
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not long before Dr. Chetwynd's eyes were fully open to the
      mistake he had made and that he realised the fact that you cannot
      fashion a Dresden vase out of earthenware, and though pinchbeck
      may pass muster for gold, it does not make it the real article.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Bella did try her "level best" as Saidie put it, to be
      all that Jack required of her. She took his lecturings humbly,
      held her peace when he scolded her (and I am afraid he constantly
      did), and acknowledged in the depths of her shallow little mind
      that she fell far short of what his wife should be. But as time
      went on she grew less solicitous about pleasing him. His standard
      was an almost impossible one to the very second-rate little
      American girl, to whom the atmosphere of the "Halls" was far more
      congenial than the humdrum, quiet life she led in the Camberwell
      New Road, and she slipped back little by little into the mire out
      of which he had raised her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can never learn to be what he wants me to," she said a little
      pathetically to Saidie&mdash;"It is like standing on tiptoe all
      the time trying to reach up to his standard. I'm sick of it. If
      he loved me well enough to marry me, the same love ought to be
      strong enough to make him contented with me. After all, I'm the
      same Bella now that I was then."
    </p>
    <p>
      A word of advice at this juncture might have quieted the poor
      little wife, and brought her back into safe paths, for she really
      loved Jack in her heart; but Saidie was not the person to give
      it. Privately she considered her sister a fool to have put up
      with this ridiculous nonsense of her husband's as long as she had
      done; and the line of argument she took was about the worst she
      could have adopted for the happiness and peace of the Camberwell
      household.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a good deal older than Bella, and the girl had been wont
      to rely upon her in a great measure, and to look up to her as a
      practical, sensible person, which Bella was quite ready to admit
      she herself was very far from being; so now, when Saidie spoke in
      a resolute, determined way, she listened meekly, if she did not
      in so many words acquiesce in the wisdom and justice of what she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As far as I can see, you don't get a bit of fun and happiness
      out of your life," remarked Saidie, critically examining her
      features in the glass. "What did you marry him for, I should like
      to know? You might as well be Bella Blackall, on the boards
      again, and free, as the wife of a stingy fellow like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Saidie, he doesn't grudge me anything." The young wife felt
      a little compunction in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes he does." Saidie turned round and faced her sister. "He
      don't like you to enjoy yourself, not a little bit. He would keep
      you wrapped up in cotton wool if he could, and if you don't make
      a stand now, once and for all, and let him see you have a mind of
      your own and intend to do as you like, you'll regret it to the
      last day of your life. Who is he, anyway? I guess our family's as
      good, if we knew anything about them, which we don't, worse luck.
      Just you give him back his own sauce, Bella, and next time he
      finds fault with you, laugh in his face and tell him he has got
      to put up with what he finds, for it ain't likely you can alter
      your nature to suit his high mightiness. Pitch on a thing or two
      he does which you don't like, and give him a sermon as long as
      your arm. You see; he will come off his pedestal. Sakes alive! he
      ought to have me to deal with; I bet I'd teach him a thing or
      two."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Saidie whipped herself off to the "Rivolette," where she
      sang a doubtful song and displayed her finely turned limbs in a
      style that would have disgusted her brother-in-law, if he had
      been there to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      But music halls were not to his liking under any circumstances.
      He had never really cared for them, even in his bachelor days,
      and now he would have cut his right hand off rather than be seen
      with his young wife beside him, at such resorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too, Dr. Chetwynd felt that it behoved him to be
      circumspect in all his actions, for his practice was steadily
      increasing and he was becoming popular, and had serious thoughts
      of migrating westward. It was a constant source of vexation to
      him that Bella was not liked as much as her handsome, clever
      husband, and he began to be painfully alive to the fact that she
      could not have been received in certain houses whose doors would
      have been gradually opened to him. In a social sense his wife was
      a failure, and with a sigh he realised that it was almost an
      impossibility to show her where the fault lay; he could not
      always be at her elbow to guard against little solecisms of
      manner and speech which he knew must jar and grate on others even
      more than on himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It went terribly against the grain, for he loved her none the
      less that his eyes were not blinded to her shortcomings. She was
      still the same winsome girl he had made his own; large-hearted,
      gentle and affectionate, but&mdash;and he sighed impatiently, for
      that something lacking was for ever pulling him back and standing
      in the way of his own social advancement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became less demonstrative, less congenial, and his practice
      made huge demands upon his time, and left but scant opportunity
      for pleasure-seeking. Lines traced themselves upon his brow and
      lurked at the corners of his mouth; he aged rapidly, and began to
      look like an elderly man while Bella was still little more than a
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of Mrs. Chetwynd's return from the maternal roof
      (for Mrs. Blackall still lived near the Waterloo Road, and her
      elder daughter continued to make her home with her), she found
      her husband, a good deal to her surprise, seated in the
      drawing-room, gay with flowers and crowded with knick-nacks of
      every description. He had in his hand a book which he flung down
      with an annoyed gesture as his wife opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps no worse than others of its type, but it had not
      an honest moral tone and was not therefore, John Chetwynd
      considered, a desirable work for his young wife's perusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you read this?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; it is one of Saidie's. Is it interesting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John Chetwynd's answer was to hurl the volume under the grate
      with an angry word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you do that? I want to read it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not allow you to sully your mind with such filth. It only
      goes to prove what I have so often told you, that your sister is
      not a proper associate for any young woman. A book of that
      description&mdash;faugh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella picked up the offending volume and looked ruefully at its
      battered condition. "I should have supposed that as a married
      woman I might read anything," she said with an assumption of
      dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should you be less pure because you have a husband, my
      child? Don't run away with any such notion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I will read it and give you my opinion of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will do no such thing. I forbid it, Bella."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a matter like this I shall judge for myself." Her cheeks were
      scarlet, and she kept her eyes downbent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bella!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time in their married life that she had defied
      him, and he looked at her in utter astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she cried, turning on him like a small fury, with the book
      tightly held in both hands; "I'm not a child to be dictated to
      and ordered to do this and that. I'm perfectly well able to act
      for myself and I intend to do so now and always. I'm sick of your
      eternal fault-finding, and the sooner you know it the better. If
      it's not one thing it's another. Nothing I do is right and I'm
      about tired of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      John Chetwynd sat perfectly silent under this tirade. He was a
      shrewd man, and he knew that Bella had been spending the evening
      with her own people, and jumped at once to the conclusion that in
      defying him she was acting by their advice, and his brow grew
      black and lowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he looked up at Bella, who, a little ashamed of her
      vehemence, was slowly unbuttoning her gloves, having laid aside
      the unlucky cause of the battle royal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wife," he said kindly, "if you will not act on my advice, let
      me beg of you to think twice before accepting that of others,
      since I at least may be credited with having your real good at
      heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you think that&mdash;you mean to imply that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That your sister has her own ends to serve? Undoubtedly I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are all wrong&mdash;all wrong." But the tell-tale blushes on
      Bella's face showed him plainly enough that he had been right in
      his conjecture, and had to thank his wife's relatives for her
      rebellion and newly developed obstinacy and resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Bella, from to-night I cannot allow you to go to Holly
      Street: stay," as Bella would have spoken, "you may see your
      mother here when you please, but you must let your sister fully
      understand that she will not be welcome. Something surely is due
      to me as your husband, and that there is no great amount of
      sympathy between you and Saidie you have said repeatedly;
      therefore I am asking no great sacrifice of you. Do you hear me,
      Bella?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I hear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will respect my wishes in the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," she spoke uncertainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not fond of her sister, as he had said; certainly not
      sufficiently fond of her to allow her to come between herself and
      Jack; and yet she felt that it would be unwise and undignified if
      she were to give in and refuse Saidie admission to their house.
      She had just declared that she would stand no coercion; and after
      all, what had poor Saidie done?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you have any right to keep my people away," she
      said at last, sullenly. "This is my house as well as yours,
      remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not going to argue over it, my dear girl." Dr. Chetwynd
      rose determinedly from his chair with an expression on his face
      which his wife had learned to know and dread. "I forbid you to
      ask your sister here again. I am sorry to have to speak so
      decidedly; but your conduct leaves me no alternative."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he walked quickly across the floor and the next moment the
      door closed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care what he says. I won't be ordered about," flashed
      out Bella, all that was worst in her nature roused by Jack's
      resolution. "Saidie is quite right; if I don't put my foot down I
      shall soon be nothing better than a white slave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Putting her foot down," certainly had one effect, namely, that
      of making life anything but a bed of roses for the unfortunate
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had Bella shown herself so unamiable and unloveable as
      during the next two days. She hardly addressed her husband and
      she flounced about the room and tossed her head and hummed
      music-hall ditties (which she had caught from Saidie) under her
      breath, and altogether comported herself in the most exasperating
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Chetwynd hardly knew how to act towards her. If he pretended
      to be unconscious of anything unusual, it would probably provoke
      her to stronger measures, and yet he was very loth to stir up
      strife between them, and leant towards the hope that this spirit
      of fractiousness would die out in time and that Bella would
      become her loving, tractable self again. But he reckoned without
      his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saidie, who was duly apprised of the condition of things, urged
      upon her sister to stick to her guns and on no account to yield
      an inch, and although desperately miserable, Bella took her
      advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning from seeing a patient a day or two later, Dr. Chetwynd
      ran into the arms of an old friend, a man he had not seen since
      his marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Meynell, old chap, where have you dropped from?" he
      exclaimed, grasping the outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where have <i>you</i> hidden yourself? is more to the purpose.
      No one ever sees you nowadays."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Chetwynd smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you do not know I am a married man," he said. "Which
      accounts for a good deal of my time, and as a matter of fact I
      have but little leisure, for my practice keeps me always at the
      grindstone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doing pretty well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think I may say I am. Uphill work, of course, but
      still&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where are you living?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Chetwynd hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Close by here," he replied the next moment. "Come home with me
      now, if you have nothing better to do, and allow me to present my
      wife to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      And they walked on side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have dined? I am afraid&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow, I have this moment left the club."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Chetwynd put his latch-key into the lock and ushered his
      friend upstairs to his wife's pretty drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bella was not there; and finding that she was not in her
      bedroom, or in fact in the house at all, he rang the bell and
      questioned the maid as to when her mistress had gone out and if
      she knew when she would be likely to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, that I'm sure I don't. My mistress never said anything
      to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, she is not likely to be away long," remarked the doctor
      philosophically. "Have a cigar, Meynell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, no. Your wife spoils you, Jack, if she allows you to
      smoke in her pretty little room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, she will not mind; but we will go down to my den shortly.
      You see, Meynell, I'm a bit of a Bohemian, although I like to
      preserve the customs of the civilised world all the same, to a
      certain extent. But my little
      wife&mdash;well&mdash;she&mdash;she&mdash;I daresay you may have
      heard she was on the stage before I married her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed I hadn't." Gus Meynell looked a good deal surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I mention it because perhaps she is not quite like the
      ordinary run of women."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meynell could no longer be blind to the want of ease in his
      host's manner, and in his turn became proportionately
      uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang it all! A man marries to please himself," he said
      awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is just the dearest girl in the world," continued Jack
      Chetwynd, with warmth. "I'm not only fond of her, but proud of
      her too, but you know&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I perfectly understand what you mean. To my idea
      unconventionality is the most charming thing a woman can have. I
      hate the bride manufactured out of the schoolgirl. The oppressive
      resemblance between most of our friends' wives is one of the
      safe-guards of society."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?" Chetwynd broke in upon his friend's speech with a
      nervous start and exclamation. The hall door opened with a loud
      bang and a woman's noisy laugh could be heard as a pelter of
      high-heeled shoes came along the tesselated hall and then the
      vision of a pretty girl at the doorway, accompanied by a man and
      two women.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Jack! You are home before me, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bella, my dear, I must introduce you to an old friend of mine:
      Meynell, my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella bowed a little coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My sister, Mr. Meynell," she said, seeing that the doctor was
      looking straight over Saidie's head. "My sister, Miss Saidie
      Blackall; daresay you have seen her from the front before." Then,
      looking towards the open door, "Come in, come in. Jack, I think
      you have already met Mr. and Mrs. Doss."
    </p>
    <p>
      Chetwynd looked terribly annoyed; but there was no choice left
      for him but to extend his hand and mutter something to the effect
      that he had not had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of
      his wife's friends before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to know you, sir&mdash;not one of us&mdash;not in the
      profession, I think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;er&mdash;no," responded Chetwynd feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the 'appier you, take my tip for it. The wear and tear of
      the 'alls, sir, no one but a pro can estimate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here his wife, an over-dressed, showy individual a shade more of
      a cockney than himself, interposed with a coarse laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get along, you jolly old humbug, you! You couldn't live away
      from them&mdash;could he, dear?" addressing Saidie, who was
      maliciously enjoying the effect that their sudden entrance had
      produced upon her brother-in-law and his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah; you think so, d'ye? that's all you know about it. Give me a
      nice quiet 'public' with a hold-established trade and me and the
      missis cosy-like in the private bar; that's the life for yours
      truly when he can take the farewell ben."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How soon are your friends going to take their leave, Bella?"
      asked Chetwynd in an undertone to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bella turned her back upon him without deigning to give him
      so much as a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I had the pleasure of seeing you perform the other
      night, Mrs. Doss," remarked Mr. Meynell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't she look a figger in tights? now tell the truth and shame
      the old gentleman: a female as fat as my wife ought not never to
      leave off her petticoats, that's what I says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Samuel, fie! You make me blush." His wife coughed discreetly
      behind her hand. "It's a new departure, I grant; but I've had a
      good many compliments paid me since I took to the nautical style,
      I can tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gammon!" grunted Mr. Doss, with a dissatisfied air. "Did you see
      her as the 'Rabbit Queen,' sir? My! the patience that woman
      displayed in the training of them little furry animals would have
      astonished you. Struck the line, sir, out of her own 'ed! 'I'm
      going, Samuel,' she said, 'to supply a want.' 'You!' I says.
      'Me!' says she; 'they have got their serpents,' she says, 'and
      their ducks, and their pigeons and their kangaroos,' 'What's
      their void?' said I. 'Rabbits,' she says, and there you are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saidie, why don't you sit down? We will have some supper
      directly," said Bella.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear, I'm dying for a drink!" cried Miss Blackall,
      flinging herself in an attitude more easy than graceful into an
      armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella opened the chiffonier and produced glasses and a spirit
      stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saves the trouble of ringing for the servant," she said archly
      to Meynell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chetwynd could fairly have groaned; and when his wife put the
      climax upon everything by drinking out of her sister's glass he
      could contain himself no longer. "I never saw you touch spirits
      before," he said, determined that his friend should know that his
      wife was an abstemious woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," she said lightly, "there are lots of things you never saw
      me do, Jack, which I am capable of, all the same." Whereupon
      Saidie burst out laughing as at some prodigious joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good for you, Bella! All right, dear! I'm not one to tell tales
      out of school."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you a married man, sir, may I ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Doss put his thumbs under his arm-pits and looked scrutinisingly
      into Meynell's face. "I should say not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm a bachelor, and likely to continue one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," remarked Mrs. Doss sentimentally, "I don't know nothing
      jollier than courting time. Such little ordinary things seem
      sweet like, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hark at the old girl," chuckled Doss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't kidd me, Doss. You know it, too. I think of our own
      billing and cooing, sir&mdash;his and mine. I was not a draw in
      those days; the last turn in the bill at the "Middlesex" was
      about my mark, and Doss, he hadn't risen, neither. We used to
      walk 'ome that lovin' up Drury Lane, and Doss, he would say,
      'fish, Tilda,' and I would say, 'if you could fancy a bit, Sam.'
      And in he would pop for two penny slices and chips. And
      eat&mdash;lor', how we did eat. When I look back on that fish,
      sometimes I could cry. Money and fame ain't everythink in the
      world, believe me, they ain't. You may be 'appy in your
      'umbleness."
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was gall and wormwood to John Chetwynd, and he
      approached his wife again and whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is getting late&mdash;are these people never going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not until they have had supper, most certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you expect my friend to join you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can please yourselves. I don't think either of you would be
      much acquisition in your present frame of mind. Mrs. Doss,
      somebody interrupted you; you were talking about a kindred soul
      and an attic. Money and position are not everything you were
      saying. I agree with you. Give me an easy life and no stilts."
    </p>
    <p>
      John Chetwynd could stand it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," he said, addressing Mrs. Doss; "I must really apologise,
      but Mr. Meynell and I have important business to discuss,
      and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doss might be vulgar, but she was not obtuse. Seeing she and
      her husband were not wanted, she sprang to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sam&mdash;right about face; we must be off 'ome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, you must have some supper before you go," said Bella.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I think we will be toddling, thanks. Are you coming with us,
      Saidie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm not," returned that young woman, sturdily. "Since this
      house is the joint property of Dr. John Chetwynd and his wife, I
      reckon I shall stop awhile. Bella, you are not going to turn me
      out, are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I. I can't imagine what Jack means by behaving so
      inhospitably. I hope you will all stop."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Doss, exceedingly affronted at the slight offered him,
      had tucked his wife's arm under his own and was already at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night, gents. My best respects to you, Mrs. Chetwynd, but
      we knows who wants us and who doesn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella turned indignantly to her husband. "And you call yourself a
      gentleman!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For heaven's sake remember we are not alone!" whispered Chetwynd
      in distress, "you have distinguished yourself quite enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care&mdash;you have insulted my friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and as good as you or I. What did you marry me for if you
      are ashamed of my connections?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not marry the whole variety stage."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Meynell rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awfully sorry, but I must be going old chap, promised to look in
      again at the club." And Chetwynd did not press him to stay.
      Humiliated to the last degree, he followed him downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have given you a very enjoyable evening, Meynell," he said
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow, what ought I to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm damned if I know; I've never visited a friend who made such
      a marriage as mine. I should have pitied the poor devil
      profoundly if I had. Good night, old chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall door shut, and Chetwynd went slowly, sorrowfully back to
      the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you have disgraced me enough to-night," he said stormily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's the disgrace, I should like to know, in inviting a
      couple of old friends into one's own house?" demanded Saidie
      aggressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chetwynd promptly turned his back upon her. "I am addressing my
      wife," he said frigidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I would like to see you talking to <i>me</i> in that tone
      of voice," returned his sister-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bella, what have you to say for yourself? Have you no
      self-respect whatever, and no consideration for your husband's
      position?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm sick of hearing about your position," said his wife
      pettishly. "In the days when you had not any, we were a lot
      happier. You didn't turn up your nose at my associates when I was
      on the boards at the Band Box! Everything was charming. You
      laughed then at what you now call "vulgar," and you thought it
      good fun, and you would have taken the property man to your heart
      if I had told you he was my brother. But now I am your wife it is
      quite a different tale. My friends are too common for you to mix
      with. By the Lord! I'm not at all certain whether you think
      <i>me</i> good enough for you, myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bella, Bella!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Yes, it is easy enough to look broken-hearted. How dare you
      turn my friends out of the place? It is you, not I, who have
      brought disgrace upon us by introducing a stranger here and
      mortifying and humbling me in front of him. If the Dosses are
      good enough for me, they are good enough for my husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear wife, they are not good enough for you. There is the
      whole truth. Why are you so altered? Why will you not listen to
      me and take my advice as you used to do? Have you forgotten how
      happy we once were with each other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little break in his voice, but Bella was too incensed
      to heed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that you did not abuse me when you had it entirely your
      own way! Wonderful! Perhaps you did not know that you bored me to
      death the whole time. And now you have got it at last. I'm tired
      of your cheap gentility and Brummagem pretensions; sick to death
      of hearing that nothing I have been used to is "proper." If my
      world is a second rate one, show me a better. Why don't you
      introduce me to your own, if it is so vastly superior? Have you
      done it? Not you! You bury me in this poky little hole and
      deliberately insult the only friends I have who take the trouble
      to come and look me up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Chetwynd passed his hand over his brow dreamily. The whole thing
      was such a shock to him, he could hardly realise it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you are saying much more than you mean," he said at last.
      "God knows if you have been dull I never suspected it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I have not grumbled&mdash;because I smiled instead of
      yawning, and laughed when I felt like crying, you never suspected
      it! Did you ever ask yourself what amusements you were providing
      for me while you were out all day? Not for a moment. Men like you
      never do, when they marry girls like us. You fancy you have been
      very noble and chivalrous and plucky; but what you have really
      done is to get what you want and leave me to pay the cost. Once
      your wife, there was an end of the matter so far as you were
      concerned, and to marry you was to complete my destiny! I was to
      sit all day long staring at the four walls, and if I happened to
      feel lonely, take a look at my marriage certificate to cheer
      myself up! well&mdash;" she drew a long breath and suddenly left
      her seat and came quite close to him. "Well," she said again, "I
      am not satisfied&mdash;do you hear? It may be the height of
      ingratitude, but it is a fact all the same. I am not content and
      I have made up my mind (you may as well know it now as at any
      other time) to go back to the stage. The life suits me and I am
      going to do it." And then she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she expected her husband to storm and rave, insist and
      expostulate, she was disappointed. He sat dumb and voiceless, his
      face buried in his hands, and he did not even look up when, with
      the air of a victor, Bella marched across the floor, beckoned to
      her sister, and went up to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never gave you credit for such real grit," began Saidie,
      admiringly; but to her surprise Bella flung herself on the bed
      and burst into uncontrollable sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I was dead," she cried. "I am a beast&mdash;an ungrateful
      beast; and I have said what is not true. I have loved him
      always&mdash;always."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you can't go back from your word now," said Saidie; "You
      said you would do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and I will." Bella sat up and dried her eyes. "I will go
      back to the stage; but I did not say I would stop there, and I
      shan't if I'm not happy, and if it makes a break between me and
      Jack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk like that," cried Saidie disdainfully, "You make me
      tired!"
    </p>
    <h2 class="chp">
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After this there was a lull; John Chetwynd observed that he had
      need of more forbearance towards his wilful wife, and tried to
      exercise it. He told himself that there was love enough and to
      spare; that with the deep affection he was convinced Bella bore
      him there was nothing really to fear. She was young and
      ill-advised, and it behoved him to keep a careful watch over her,
      and above all things not to draw too tight a rein. As for her
      threat of returning to her old life and its meretricious
      attractions, after the first shock he dismissed it from his mind.
      She had not really intended doing anything of the sort; such a
      step was impossible. It was a wild idea, born of the excitement
      of the moment, and unworthy of a further thought, and so he put
      it aside. Had not the question been argued and threshed out once
      and for all soon after marriage? He recalled with a curious lump
      in his throat how she had put her hands into his and said; "Your
      wishes are my wishes, now and always, Jack." And there had been
      an end of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will wait until the atmosphere has cleared a little," said
      John Chetwynd, reflectively, "and then I'll tell her that at the
      end of the year we will leave Camberwell and take a larger house
      in a better neighbourhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, out of his love for his young wife, he made excuses for her
      and took her back to his heart again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Bella? Jack's conduct puzzled her. She had fully expected
      that he would be exceedingly angry and displeased, and in her own
      mind had prepared certain little set phrases which were to
      impress him with the fact that she intended to do as she pleased
      and would not allow herself to be dictated to or coerced. And
      thus it was that on the following morning she came down to
      breakfast with it must be confessed a forbidding look upon her
      pretty face and a defiant air about her bearing. But all her
      newly formed resolves were put to flight when Jack came towards
      her and deliberately kissed the lips which she vainly tried to
      withhold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bella, you and I love each other too well to quarrel," he said
      kindly; "let us forget all that happened last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      What could she say? In spite of herself she felt that she was
      yielding; and though she did not meet him half way as he had
      fondly anticipated she would do, still she allowed him to draw
      her into his arms and did not repulse his caresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might have shown a more generous spirit, it is true. Since he
      had tacitly acknowledged that they had been mutually to blame,
      she might have offered something in the shape of an expression of
      regret; but peace in any shape and at any cost Chetwynd felt he
      must have.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bella had by no means surrendered her determination of going
      on the stage again, and was already with Saidie's assistance on
      the look-out for an engagement. It would be difficult to define
      her feelings towards her husband at this juncture. That there was
      still a veiled hostility John Chetwynd could not fail to see; but
      in his newly formed resolution to be patient and forbearing, he
      simply ignored it and diligently cultivated a kindly, gentle
      bearing, interesting himself in her little domesticities and the
      general routine of her everyday life. This amused Bella
      intensely, and although she would not have acknowledged it,
      perhaps touched her a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why had he not done this before? And having been careless and
      indifferent once, why was he not so still? For this is how it was
      with Bella; she was learning to compare her husband with her
      lover, and be very sure the former suffered by comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Les absents ont toujours tort" and Saidie found so much to say
      and said it in such a contemptuous, scornful way to Howard
      Astley, about her sister's husband, that perhaps there was some
      little excuse for the young man's impression that Bella Chetwynd
      would be vastly better off under his protection than amid her
      present surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man was a brute," Miss Blackall declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor John Chetwynd! Not only was he far removed from being a
      brute, but he was also miles above the man whom Saidie delighted
      to honour, and whose addresses and attentions she thrust upon
      Bella at every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, to do her justice, the young wife shrank back dismayed.
      Beyond his handsome face, Howard Astley had but little to
      recommend him, and after listening to his commonplaces and
      enduring the fulsome compliments it pleased him to pay, she would
      hurry home with tingling pulses and a shamed heart to
      Jack&mdash;Jack, who had once been all the world to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once! Oh, and such a little time ago! After all, how little she
      had to complain of in the man who had made her his wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was "uninteresting," wrapped up in his profession, "dull."
      That was all, but it meant a very great deal to Bella. It meant
      everything; and the sluggish conscience which just at first had a
      word or two to say in his defence, gradually went to sleep again
      and troubled its owner no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should she not enjoy herself as other women of her age did?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, indeed? She did not intend to do anything that was really
      wrong, or even unbecoming in her position as Jack's wife; but
      still she was resolved on extracting the utmost amount of
      amusement possible out of life, and thus with slow, subtle
      drifting and unconscious eyes&mdash;eyes that would not see their
      peril&mdash;she reached the point where temptation steps in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his wealth that dazzled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did so long to be rich. John was apt to be mean about
      trifles, but this man&mdash;the man she allowed to make love to
      her&mdash;was a very prodigal in his liberality. He spent money
      like water. He rarely came empty-handed. Probably he knew the
      manner of woman he had to deal with, and Bella hid the trinkets
      away with a guilty blush; they were not much good to her after
      all, for she did not dare to wear them, lest Jack should ask
      awkward questions concerning the source from whence they came.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never can do anything I like," said Bella with a pout.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there came a night when John Chetwynd found the pretty
      drawing-room deserted and his wife flown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours went by and as she did not return he grew seriously
      uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where could she be? When eleven o'clock struck he put on his hat
      and, terribly though it went against the grain, started for Holly
      Street&mdash;she might be at her mother's.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Mrs. Blackall had not seen her, she said; and she looked
      searchingly into her son-in-law's face as she spoke. "Did Dr.
      Chetwynd really not know where she was?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam, or assuredly I should not be here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor spoke with some heat; that there was something behind
      all this was very evident, and he naturally objected to being
      made a fool of.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know, then, that Bella is on at the Tivoli?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John Chetwynd sat down suddenly. This news literally took his
      breath away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not possible that Bella had taken such a step without his
      knowledge or sanction. He looked up with such hopeless misery
      written in his white face that Mrs. Blackall could not help a
      certain pity for her son-in-law, although in her opinion he had
      brought the thing upon himself, and the very compassion she felt
      for his suffering had the effect of making her more harsh and
      unsympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you expect?" she asked. "As a man of the world could
      you really imagine that a young, high-spirited girl like my
      daughter would content herself with the life you tried to chain
      her down to? She had had just taste enough of the admiration and
      applause of a public life to get a liking for it, and in an
      instant it is all taken away and nothing given her in its place.
      It ain't commonsense, it&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may not be," said Chetwynd wearily; "but there are women
      nevertheless to whom home and husband are all-sufficient and who
      ask for nothing beyond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You made a great mistake, Mr. Chetwynd, when you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did," he interrupted quickly; "you are perfectly right; I did
      when I believed my wife and your daughter to be one of these.
      Well," and he rose wearily, "she has put a barrier between us
      to-night that can never be broken down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut, tut, man; you have got your duty to do by her, and I'll
      take good care you do it. She is doing no wrong to join her
      profession again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our ideas as to right and wrong probably differ. I am certainly
      not going to argue the point, nor do I wish to shirk what
      responsibility I took on my shoulders when I married. But if it
      is upon your advice she has acted in this matter, ask God to
      forgive you for the cruel wrong you have done us both!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he picked up his hat and went out of the house. It was long
      past midnight when Bella returned; but late though it was, she
      knew by the lights in the drawing room that her husband was
      waiting up for her, and with an impatient sigh, determined to get
      her lecture over, she ran lightly up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was there, sitting in her own cosy armchair, and he looked
      round expectantly as the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," she said nervously, stripping off her gloves, and
      avoiding meeting his stern, sad gaze. "I daresay you wonder where
      I have been and what has kept me so late; but, my dear old Jack,
      you will have to give up the bad habit of sitting up to all hours
      for me, for I'm likely to be late most nights now."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused for a reply, but none came. Her easy assurance
      staggered him; he could hardly believe that this self-composed,
      glib-spoken young woman had been at one time his diffident, shy
      little love. The unhappy man found it very hard to reconcile the
      two. "Why don't you speak?" she asked impatiently, facing him in
      a defiant manner; and as he looked up at her he noticed for the
      first time that she had grown older and had lost all at
      once&mdash;at least, so it seemed to him&mdash;the rounded,
      childish look from her sweet face and involuntarily a sigh broke
      from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One would think I had committed a crime," cried she in disdain,
      and then, catching her skirts up, she broke into a step dance,
      humming a popular music-hall air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop&mdash;do you hear me?&mdash;this instant stop!" the devil
      in him burst out; he could restrain himself no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Woman! What are you made of?" he cried in a voice of thunder,
      and she, shrinking back a little, fell half frightened into a
      chair. He never could quite remember afterwards what he did say.
      He tried with rough eloquence, that might have moved a heart of
      stone, to show her what it was she was doing, to appeal to her
      better, nobler self, to her love for him; he implored and
      entreated her to give up this new life&mdash;for his sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had nothing better to urge than that, poor fool! It weighed
      with her as just so much chaff. The time had gone by when his
      words would have touched her; they glided lightly over what she
      called her "heart" now and left no impression there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he went on his knees beside her and prayed her to grant
      him this one boon; he poured out a flood of feverish words,
      hardly pausing to think; he tried to paint an alluring picture of
      their life in the future: they would leave Camberwell, he said;
      she should go where she liked if she would but listen to reason;
      it would ruin him in his profession, he pleaded, if she persisted
      in returning to the stage. As he talked the pretty face grew
      harder and older. Bella had made up her mind, and the man beside
      her had not the faintest power to sway her by his reproaches or
      entreaties.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he stumbled to his feet and stood waiting for his
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came at last, clear and cold, falling like pellets of ice upon
      his impatient fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The thing is done now, and all the talking in the world will not
      alter it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that is your last word to me&mdash;your husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding she did not speak, he walked across the floor, turning at
      the door, hoping against hope, but she lay back as still as if
      she were dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone, Bella opened her eyes and held up her hand
      curiously. It was wet with&mdash;what?&mdash;tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were bright and dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment something of the old feeling swept over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Jack! She half rose, then sank back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late, she was thinking; as if it were ever too late to
      make amends, to atone, while we have still breath and life!
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all for the best, anyhow," she murmured after awhile, and
      when philosophy is well to the fore, love hides its diminished
      head.
    </p>

      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Six months wore themselves away; six months in every day of which
      John Chetwynd lived a year, measured by the anxiety and misery it
      held for him. He could no longer delude himself into the belief
      that Bella loved him, for all her actions went to prove the
      contrary. But her end just once gained, there were no more
      bickerings and disputes&mdash;she even condescended to consider
      her husband's wishes, when they did not clash or interfere with
      her own. But night after night he sat alone with the hateful
      consciousness that the woman who bore his name was parading her
      charms to Dick, Tom and Harry; in fact, to anybody who chose to
      pay his shilling for the privilege of contemplating them. It was
      in moments such as these that the iron entered his soul and there
      was no escape from it; he must bear his burden as many a better
      man had borne it before him. And thus it was he buried himself in
      his profession, working with a will and vigour that astonished no
      one so much as himself. He was rapidly becoming a popular man.
      Through sheer good luck (as he really believed it to be) he had
      diagnosed one or two cases with an ease and accuracy which not
      only filled his purse beyond his utmost expectations, but helped
      him up the ladder of fame at an amazing rate. But when emboldened
      by success, and always remembering the fact that however wilful
      and oblivious she might be, she was still to all intents and
      purposes the wife of his bosom and equally interested with
      himself in all his undertakings, he recounted his triumphs and
      declared his intention of leaving Camberwell forthwith and
      settling in Camelot Square, Bella smiled, yet proved in no way
      elated at the intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, my dear, you can go as soon as you like and fix upon a
      house," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella yawned and stretched her arms above her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you will know much better than I what is required," she
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you, then, no interest in our new home?" he asked, more
      hurt than he could well have expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you ever show the slightest interest in what concerns me?"
      she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He winced. "This is a mutual interest, surely, since we must
      occupy it together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must?" she echoed dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" he asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, except that 'must' is the word I have banished from my
      vocabulary," and she smiled at him&mdash;actually smiled, though
      she must have known she was stabbing him to the very heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said no more; and indeed, words seemed to be useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he chose the house himself,&mdash;one that could not fail to
      please Bella, he felt exultantly. She would be less than woman if
      she were not glad to exchange the second-rate little dwelling in
      the Camberwell New Road for the substantial residence, with its
      modern improvements and embellishments in such a neighbourhood as
      Camelot Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not perhaps a palace, but it was a very great deal more
      imposing than anything they had dreamt of in the early days of
      their married life, and yet John Chetwynd told himself with a
      sigh that he would gladly give up fame and prosperity to win back
      the old love-light in his wife's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there are some among us who cannot love for so
      little&mdash;"Of man's love a thing apart." Perhaps John Chetwynd
      would have been a happier man had he been one of these.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the task of furnishing fell to the doctor's lot. Bella did
      not refuse, nor did she object to accompany him on what he might
      have naturally supposed would be a congenial task for her, but
      she showed herself so indifferent throughout that, after an
      effort or two to make her contented, he gave it up, and it ended
      in his carrying the whole thing through himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was not sorry when at length it was completed. On the
      morrow he would bring Bella to her new home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood under the bright lighted chandelier and looked round
      him. The carpet was thick and soft. Bella liked carpets her feet
      could sink into, she had once said. There by the fireplace was
      the most luxurious easy chair he could purchase, upholstered in
      her favourite colour, pale blue. He pictured the dainty figure
      nestling in it, and a little glow stirred at his heart. After
      all, she was his wife, his fondly loved wife, and who could tell?
      Perhaps with the old life, old feuds would die out and with the
      new, joy and happiness dawn for them both once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Chetwynd was not a religious man; he rarely went to church
      and he never prayed; but now he covered his face with his hands,
      and his lips moved inaudibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was asking for a blessing on the new life, and there was
      something like a tear in his eye and a suspicious huskiness in
      his voice as he called out "Come in" in answer to a hurried knock
      at the door and flung open the lid of a grand piano which was
      littered with music and songs, running his hands over the keys
      and smiling a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      The piano was to be a surprise: Bella knew nothing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it would keep her more at home, for she was very fond of
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had cost more than he ought to have paid, but still it was for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in, Mrs. Brewer&mdash;what is it? I'm just off. You will
      have us both here to-morrow at this time for good and all, I
      hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, sir, and I'm glad to hear it. Things do look most
      beautiful, and no mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good soul shambled across the floor and held out a letter
      wrapped in the corner of her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A boy brought it, sir, half an hour ago, but I clean forgot it,
      and that's a fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind. It is probably of no importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was. By-and-by his eyes fell on it as it lay where Mrs.
      Brewer's hard-working fingers had placed it, on the edge of a
      little gaily-lined work table destined to hold Bella Chetwynd's
      cotton and needles, and to his astonishment he observed it was in
      his wife's handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! written just before she started for the&mdash;&mdash;.He
      caught it up and tore it open. The next instant it fluttered from
      his hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      For fully ten seconds John Chetwynd sat spell-bound, and then he
      broke into a laugh&mdash;mirthless, hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I prayed to my God to send his blessing
      on&mdash;our&mdash;future," he said in a dull, mechanical manner.
      "Well, the last act is played out and they may ring the curtain
      down. From to-night I believe neither in woman, Heaven, nor hell,
      save that which each man makes for himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella had turned her shapely back on the apotheosis of
      respectability for a life of excitement and the protection of
      another man. Nobody was surprised but John himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody had predicted it months ago. The only astonishing
      feature of the scandal was, that it had not occurred before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one other thing people found surprising was the callousness
      with which the injured husband took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had always been believed that what love there was, was on his
      side, but now&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it is indeed an ill wind that blows us no good. If
      notoriety was what John Chetwynd desired, he got it in full
      measure, well pressed down and brimming over; his waiting room
      was besieged, for many patients flocked there, wide eyed in
      scrutiny, martyrs to symptoms discovered or invented for the
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he would divorce her. And he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due course he obtained his decree <i>nisi</i>, which later on
      was made absolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella's picture no longer stared him in the face from every
      hoarding, and the newspaper advertisements knew her no more. She
      had gone back to the States, and by-and-by was forgotten on this
      side the Atlantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then he was disagreeably reminded of her existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in the Club a young fellow to whom Chetwynd was personally
      unknown stretched himself behind a newspaper and muttered, "Bella
      Blackall Wasn't that the name of Dr. Somebody's wife who ran away
      with another fellow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Bella Blackall was my wife," John Chetwynd answered with
      unruffled equanimity, picking up the paper which the other had
      thrown down. "She used to be rather a clever dancer, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he calmly perused the line which included her name among some
      well known American stars touring in the provinces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he never turned a grizzled hair! I give you my word I felt
      more over the thing than he did," remarked Captain Hetherington
      afterwards; "without exception the most cold-blooded individual
      ever met."
    </p>
    <p>
      But John Chetwynd was far from being this. He had felt his wife's
      desertion far too deeply to show his scars, nor was he a man to
      wear his heart upon his sleeve; but as time went by and the utter
      callousness of Bella's conduct came home to him, he realised to
      the full that she was unworthy of a single pang, and he became
      reconciled to the inevitable. His profession claimed every spare
      moment, and for a man ill at ease there is no specific like hard
      work. By-and-by as the years rolled on, another distraction
      presented itself. He became interested in one of his patients,
      the only daughter of the Duke of Huddersfield, Lady Ethel
      Claremont, and this interest blossomed into something stronger
      and warmer&mdash;something that at last he dignified by the name
      of love, though he was by no means without misgivings as to
      whether it could ever really lay claim to the title.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain it was that there was no more of the old exultation about
      his heart that had formed so large a part of his former
      courtship; there were no extravagances, no quickened
      pulses&mdash;rapture's warmth had yielded to the mildest of
      after-glows; but there was no reason that it should not prove as
      satisfactory in the long run. It is an open question whether the
      doctor, popular though he undoubtedly was, would have been
      considered an eligible suitor from the maternal point of view,
      had it not been that just about this time fortune elected to
      bestow another favour upon him; his career had reached its apex,
      and (again through sheer good luck, as John Chetwynd modestly
      declared) he was offered a baronetcy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, every man is flattered and gratified that his merits should
      be recognised, and Chetwynd was no exception to the general rule,
      but there were a good many bitters mingled with the sweets, and
      the hidden thorn among the rose-leaves had a nasty trick of
      obtruding itself. This step in social advancement materially
      helped his cause with Lady Ethel, and the Duchess of Huddersfield
      deigned to smile graciously upon her future son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel Claremont was an excellent girl, precisely the type he
      ought to marry. Decorous, with an ease and repose about her
      manner that were eminently patrician, she would be even more
      admirable as a wife than as a <i>fiance</i>, but he could have
      found it in him to wish that she were just a little less
      faultless, a little more "human," he would have said, only that
      the word has not a pleasant ring; yet it was not easy to
      substitute another unless it were "womanly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" he cried angrily, "who am I that I should be exacting,
      with such a past, such a history? and yet I am ready to quarrel
      with perfection, I who can never be grateful enough! A little
      wealth and the love of a charming woman&mdash;what more can I
      possibly desire? It is strange how soon one becomes accustomed to
      changes in life, and how quickly an emotion fades into a memory.
      If I could but feel as I felt when I was struggling along
      battling with the hundred and one difficulties which beset the
      path of a poor man, instead of having to remind myself
      perpetually what my emotions were then, there would be some
      excitement in the contrast. I&mdash;I wonder&mdash;what she is
      doing? Is she alive or is she dead? What does it matter? But at
      times the doubt will come whether&mdash;no, no; it is
      wicked&mdash;I was always good to her. I loved her, and she
      dishonoured me. The book is closed for ever, and I am weak when I
      reopen it."
    </p>
    <h2 class="chp">
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since the thing was to be, there was nothing to be gained by
      postponement. So decided the Duchess, and however fond of airing
      her own sentiments and securing her own way Lady Ethel might be,
      on ordinary occasions, for once she raised no objection. She was
      perfectly willing that her marriage with Sir John Chetwynd should
      take place at once. Perhaps in her home Lady Ethel was not quite
      the plastic lay figure she was wont to appear in public, and the
      Duchess had spoken to her most intimate and confidential friends
      of the approaching nuptials with almost a sigh of relief, and a
      whispered word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has indeed been very difficult to manage, and really, though
      I am speaking of my own daughter, I never can quite understand
      Ethel; she is not like other girls. It will be a huge
      responsibility shifted from my shoulders when she is married."
    </p>
    <p>
      And everybody had wondered what the girl had seen in Sir John,
      that he should have taken her fancy. To the outside world and to
      those who had not come within the immediate charm of his manner
      and bearing, it did offer food for speculation, and since his
      engagement he had grown greyer and stiffer and more
      professionally precise than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he suited Lady Ethel, or she fancied he did; which answered
      the purpose quite as well. She had always detested very young
      men; she liked a man whom she could look up to and lean upon, and
      certainly this she could do with perfect faith as regarded her
      <i>fianc</i>. Now Duchesses are no more exempt from the weary
      ills which weak flesh is heir to than their less favoured
      brothers and sisters, and in the early summer the Duchess began
      to complain of certain aches and pains and to bethink her that
      Sir John's advice might be worth following; so she drove over to
      Camelot Square and was shown into the waiting room with the rest
      of his patients. She had some little time to wait, and while the
      Duchess sat tapping her foot impatiently at the delay, Ethel
      looked round the spacious apartment and decided on certain
      improvements she would effect when she should preside over John's
      establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the door was flung open, and Soames, the eminently
      correct footman, ushered them into his master's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess advanced gushing a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So good of you to see us so soon! I was positively timid at
      coming without an appointment, even with Ethel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is you who are good, Duchess, to give me such an unexpected
      pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John touched Ethel's cheek lightly with his lips and motioned
      his visitors to be seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now is not that a pretty speech from a professional man! Ah, you
      lovers, you are all alike, and when you are married&mdash;Ah!
      then you are all the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an accusation! I hope Ethel does not credit it, or I shall
      never be permitted an opportunity of refuting such a calumny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know too well how highly Mamma thinks of you, John," said
      Ethel, prettily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I admit it&mdash;I do admire you immensely&mdash;I admire
      your power, your position, your ability to make an income&mdash;a
      large income, sitting comfortably in an arm chair. And then there
      is such solidity in a doctor's profession&mdash;people are always
      ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mamma is ill herself," broke in Lady Ethel, "and that is why we
      have intruded to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope it is nothing serious, my dear Duchess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How sweet of you! Ah, I am a martyr! I have hay fever to such a
      distressing extent that I am positively ashamed to go into
      society."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her daughter laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were at the Opera last night, and Mamma's sneezes were most
      <i>mal--propos.</i> It was very embarrassing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am convinced that Romeo glowered at me, and at church on
      Sunday it was such a charming sermon, so encouraging and tactful,
      I sneezed violently in the man's best moments. At my age I cannot
      consent to become a public infliction, yet I feel I am a
      nuisance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mamma said, as soon as we got home&mdash;'I shall go and consult
      Sir John,'" cooed Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now you can cure me?" The Duchess looked anxiously into the
      grave face opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not the slightest doubt you will be entirely recovered in
      a few days at most," said Sir John reassuringly; "you have caught
      a severe cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the sort, I assure you. I have had colds before, and
      I know better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, better than your doctor?" The stern face relaxed, and Sir
      John laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, better than my future son-in-law. Now I beg you not to be
      obstinate. Give me something potent&mdash;one of those drugs that
      work such instantaneous wonders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear they are not in the Pharmacopoeia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think it is kind of you to discourage me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if I make you well in a week, will not that satisfy your
      Grace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be radiant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will write you a prescription."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks! What an invaluable husband you will make with all that
      knowledge at your finger ends! I need have no misgivings as to
      Ethel's health, and she has always been so subject to chills. The
      risk of entrusting one's daughter to an unobservant man is
      shocking, but to a physician! To have for one's daily companion a
      great and renowned doctor, what an advantage&mdash;what a
      security!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, mamma, to hear you talk one would suppose that I was an
      invalid, and I never remember to have suffered from anything
      worse than the measles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Ethel comes to me she will be guarded as sacredly as a girl
      can be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John smiled kindly at his betrothed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have made but a few protestations of what I feel for her;
      perhaps I am more reserved than I should be, but I am no longer a
      boy. I doubt whether I ever was very romantic, even in my younger
      days, but I think that she and I understand each other, and if we
      don't tiff and 'make it up,' if we have been engaged three months
      and have never had a quarrel, that does not mean that my
      affection is not most sincere and deep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should hope we like each other too well to quarrel," said Lady
      Ethel haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like! After all, was it love on either side? Sir John asked
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Sir John," broke in the Duchess pompously. "A few words
      from such a man as yourself impress me more profoundly than
      rhapsodies from another. Ethel, just look out of the window and
      see if the carriage is waiting. We are going to take the
      Lancaster girls to the Academy, and Payne has driven round to
      fetch them while we had our consultation with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, mamma, it is there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will follow you in a minute, Ethel; say good-bye to
      John&mdash;," and when the door had closed upon her daughter, she
      began hurriedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is hardly the time and place perhaps, but you will pardon
      that. I&mdash;really, it is very awkward. Can you not help me,
      Sir John? The weeks are slipping by, and I should, I confess,
      like to make my arrangements for leaving home, but until I know
      definitely what yours are&mdash;."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; yours and Ethel's."
    </p>
    <p>
      A light broke in upon Sir John's somewhat obtuse mind. He had no
      desire to expedite matters, but then he was not the principal
      person to be consulted, and it certainly was not for him to raise
      any objection, so he acted immediately on the hint given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Duchess, what can I say? The matter rests entirely in
      your hands. Let it be when you please. In another month I shall
      be comparatively free, and we can visit Switzerland if Ethel
      wishes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess smiled. "That you must arrange with Ethel herself,
      and perhaps you had better broach the subject yourself to her.
      Girls are apt to be a little curious on these points."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I will ask her to fix the day for our marriage." He bowed
      with old-fashioned gallantry over the pearl-grey suede, held out
      in farewell, and the Duchess rustled away with Soames, the
      deferential, in close attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames did not like the idea of a mistress, but these "accidents"
      he was well aware, would happen in the best regulated families,
      so he was now bent on making friends with the Mammon of
      Unrighteousness in the shape of the Duchess of Huddersfield and
      the bride elect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Sir John stood upright, his hand on the back of his
      chair and his brows tightly drawn together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, why not? What possible excuse could he make to his own
      heart for the delay?
    </p>
    <p>
      None, none. And yet he felt a good deal as if a thunderbolt had
      fallen from the skies at his feet, and it was more or less of a
      shock to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he rang his bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who comes next, Soames?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Rutherven, Sir John, but&mdash;but a lady who has no
      appointment has been waiting for more than an hour, and I thought
      perhaps you would see her first. She seems very ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Show her in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A second later the door swung open again and Soames announced:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Blackall!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John started, but recovered himself in the next instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take a seat, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved her to a chair and for several minutes they looked at
      each other without speaking. The woman was the first to break the
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come back," she said with a nervous laugh. "I am ill; I
      thought you might try to cure me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seated herself, but he remained standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a handsome woman she had become, he was thinking, and how
      expensively dressed! There was something strange in the very
      familiarity of the countenance presented to him. It had altered
      much from what he remembered it, but curiously enough he
      remembered it the more vividly because of that very alteration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your trouble?" he asked huskily&mdash;"Why have you
      consulted&mdash;me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my lungs. I don't know&mdash;let us call it a whim. I
      thought you would do me good if anyone could." She paused a
      second: "You used to be my husband once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once! Well, I am willing to be your doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you would do your best for a dog if it were dying,
      wouldn't you? though you might not care if it recovered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a very faithful dog," he said significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dogs ask so little for their love. Oh, I didn't come here
      without a struggle. And I knew you would speak like this. But I
      have been abroad so long, and on the voyage home I got worse, and
      women&mdash;women of your sort who had taken no notice of me,
      suddenly grew kind. I said to myself, 'Bella, it looks bad for
      you when ladies forget how common you are,' and then the thought
      struck me, London meant you! As a patient I might come to your
      house and be let in. You are clever and you are great; if I had
      any self-respect I could not ask you; but I have not, you know; I
      never had any and'&mdash;and&mdash;I am&mdash;frightened! It
      keeps me awake at nights, the fear. I&mdash;I am not going
      to&mdash;die?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have said I will do what I can for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will sound me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Loosen your dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he bent over her she raised her hand as if to smoothe his
      hair, and the colour came into her face, but she did not touch
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers, from which she had drawn her gloves, were laden with
      rings&mdash;rings which he had not given her. His breath came a
      little faster as he stooped over her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be scared to tell me the truth," she said; "I guess I'm
      pretty bad. You need not take the trouble to lie about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He examined her thoroughly and replaced the stethoscope before he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your lungs are not right. They used to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," she replied bitterly, "I used to be. I have come too
      late&mdash;is that what you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that you must exercise great care and avoid excitement.
      Don't brood&mdash;don't worry yourself by misgivings, which will
      only do you harm. Go away from England when the summer is over;
      go where the sun shines and the air is mild. Lead a life of ease
      and indolence. I can say no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then I see no reason why you should not live for years to
      come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella flung her hands out with a sort of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your prescription is impossible," she said dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have only just come over from the States. I have an engagement
      at the Empire for six months. I have got to stay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be very unwise. The laws of health demand that you
      should cancel any such contract."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beggars can't be choosers. I must sing to live. It is my trade
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed. "You do not look as if you were in pecuniary
      difficulties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I make money easily enough, but it melts like ice cream;
      everything is so beastly dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not with&mdash;him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Him? Oh no; he left me years ago. I am alone&mdash;very much
      alone. It seems sometimes as if I had spent the best part of my
      life alone. I am so dull I&mdash;I wonder why I dread to die.
      There! I can follow your advice so far as this; I'll take the
      greatest care of myself&mdash;in London. I am glad I came to you,
      though it does not seem to have delighted you much. I suppose
      if&mdash;if I had run straight and stayed with you, I might have
      been quite well, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is difficult to say. Bella, have you&mdash;it is a foolish
      question, but&mdash;have you ever regretted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, as to that&mdash;what is the good of looking back, anyhow? I
      have and I haven't&mdash;when I have been sick it has been awful
      lonesome. You didn't grieve much, that's certain. And you got
      your title soon after I went. It was lucky for you. Scot! I
      should have been Lady Chetwynd if I had stopped with you,
      wouldn't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would have been an honest woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" She rose from her chair and looked curiously round the
      room. "I remember those bronzes," she said; "they used to hang in
      your little library in the old house. You are a good deal changed
      in the face; your manner is just the same. You were always a good
      fellow, I will say that. I know it better than I used to now I
      have had so&mdash;since I have been&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush&mdash;the past is dead. I was not so patient and tender
      with you as I should have been."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You saw that&mdash;you had made a mistake, but you tried to hide
      how sorry you were&mdash;I know you did that and I&mdash;well, I
      didn't marry you to make you sorry. Do you know how we
      lived&mdash;he and I, when I left you? He took me to Paris; and
      didn't we make the dollars spin, the pair of us&mdash;rather; and
      then one fine morning we heard a beastly bank had gone smash and
      he had lost pretty well all he had got."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you left him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile curled the corners of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said, slowly; "I didn't. We took two little rooms over
      a baker's shop in the High Street, Islington, and I stuck to him.
      I used to go out in an evening and do the marketing with a hand
      basket, to get it cheap. When we wanted a change we would take a
      bus to the Park and look at the swells across the railings; and
      sometimes Saidie gave us tickets for the theatres. Seems odd,
      don't it? but it's a fact. I was livelier then than ever I've
      been in my life. While he was fond of me&mdash;he showed me he
      was fond of me, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were capable of love, then, after all?" he said bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I loved the freedom I think, anyway, and perhaps I
      took him with it. I don't know! what does it matter? It was a
      release for you and you are glad that it happened, eh? now that
      the shame of it is forgotten? We were never suited to each other,
      were we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why speak of what is past?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, if I had remained with you I should have been no
      happier," said Bella, reflectively; "you expected too much from
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did my best to make you happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, perhaps! then if I had been more grateful and different,
      would you be glad if I was with you still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot answer that question. I loved you&mdash;I had no
      thought for any human being outside yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But now," she persisted, "now that the wound is old, do you not
      say to yourself, 'it was better so'? Suppose that you and I were
      still what we were once to each other, would you be happy to know
      that I was your wife to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg you to be silent. It is impossible that we can discuss
      such a question."
    </p>
    <p>
      She came close to his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am," she said with a sort of feverish eagerness, "no more of a
      lady now than I was then. I am just what I used to be when I made
      you ashamed of my ignorance and my mistakes. But if I were pure,
      if I had never been divorced, if I were standing here your
      faithful wife, would you be glad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! You are paining yourself and me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For God's sake be still!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell on her knees beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack, say you would be glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you had never left me, if you had remained my faithful wife,
      heaven knows that I should be a happier man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella burst into tears and sobbed convulsively, then pressed her
      handkerchief to her mouth. It was bright with blood when she
      withdrew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, be careful of yourself," said John Chetwynd, terribly moved;
      "you must do what I advise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll try. I wonder why you should care one way or the other. It
      is more than I deserve&mdash;you make me so sorry and ashamed. I
      shall never see you any more, shall I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I understand, I ought not to ask you. Well, good-bye. There
      is my address if you should take a notion to come. It is only a
      six months' engagement over here, and if I'm not long for this
      wicked world, I may not live to finish it. Keep my card. If one
      day you should feel that you could come&mdash;just once. You
      don't hate me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hate you? No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare not ask you to forgive; but I begin to know and feel what
      my action towards you really meant. Jack, see I am on my knees.
      Forgive me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. I forgive. If I was hard to you; if, as you say, I
      expected and exacted too much from you, may God forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears were still raining down Bella's cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kiss me, Jack."
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrank back. "You must not ask me that. I cannot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it that you despise me so utterly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; you don't understand. I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kiss me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you make me speak? I am going to be married again. I
      kissed her&mdash;a young girl&mdash;in this room half an hour
      ago. I could not outrage her trust in me."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sort of stung expression came into the face of the kneeling
      woman and she staggered to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going to take another wife! My God! I never
      thought&mdash;I never dreamt. It seemed
      so&mdash;so&mdash;impossible. I hope she will make you happier
      than I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hush, hush!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is one of your own class&mdash;a lady? What is her name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather not mention it. Give me your hand and let us part
      in peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell it me," she pleaded. "What name do you call her by?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ethel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ethel and Bella. Ah, Ethel is far the nicer name. We didn't
      think once that you would ever be telling me you were going to be
      married to someone else, did we? It feels queer, and it hurts
      me&mdash;a little, I think. Good-bye, Jack. I see now why you
      could not kiss me&mdash;it would not be right of you. She is a
      young girl and she might find it hard to forgive you if she knew.
      I am going. You used to have a bell on your table, I recollect,
      with a little white knob that you pressed when Mary was to go to
      the hall door. Do you use it still? Oh, I see. Let me press it
      instead of you, may I? I sha'n't feel so much as if you were
      turning me out. Good-bye." She said the word lingeringly,
      tenderly. "Say 'Bella' once again, for the sake of old times."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Chetwynd took the slender trembling hand in his with God
      knows what of anguish and pity stirring at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye&mdash;Bella."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the door fell to.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could hear her hollow cough as she passed down the tesselated
      corridor.
    </p>
    <h2 class="chp">
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was two days later. Sir John Chetwynd sat in his big easy
      chair with an open letter before him. "We are surprised to have
      seen and heard nothing of you," wrote the Duchess; "more
      especially as after the few words we had in private upon a
      certain important matter, I fully anticipated an early visit from
      you. But such a busy man as yourself and one so much in request,
      both socially and professionally, must not be judged by the rules
      which govern the common herd, I suppose; at the same time
      (although I assure you she has not said a word upon the subject)
      I can say that dear Ethel feels herself a wee bit neglected. You
      must have been <i>professionally</i> engaged last night, I
      presume, since we were obliged to dine without you and go to see
      Sarah Bernhardt alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had spent the whole evening in his consulting rooms, totally
      forgetting his promise to escort his <i>fiance</i> and her
      mother to the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he would see them both on the morrow and make his peace,
      and then&mdash;he dropped his head on his hands and fairly
      groaned. It was useless to argue with himself, to bring
      commonsense to bear upon the point, to count up the advantages to
      be derived from this union with Lady Ethel; look at it which way
      he would, the fact remained the same, that he had no longer the
      remotest desire to marry again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knowledge had certainly come tardily, but not the less
      surely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not, he told himself, love Lady Ethel as a man should love
      the wife of his bosom. Middle-aged, worn, and unemotional though
      he might be, he knew that he was yet capable of a much deeper
      feeling than she had evoked and he had wakened to a realisation
      of this since he had again seen Bella.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was no fool; he was, on the contrary, a shrewd, clever,
      quick-witted man of the world and it was impossible to shut his
      eyes to the trouble. He thought of Bella as she was when he had
      first married her; he recalled their courtship, her pretty half
      shy, half tender ways&mdash;the girlish prettiness which time had
      turned into shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had left a scrap of lace on his table for her throat or her
      veil&mdash;Heaven knew what&mdash;and his eyes grew blurred and
      dim as he gazed at it. He repeated mentally phrases which had
      fallen from her, piecing them together and trying to weave the
      pattern of her life out of the fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had changed pathetically. She had acquired the manner that
      her sister used to have, and which he had so strenuously objected
      to&mdash;the slangy, devil-may-care tone, the total absence of
      which in the old days had made his little sweetheart so
      conspicuously different from her environment. She wore now the
      impress of evil, from her Regent Street hat to her Paris gown.
      Manifestly she had risen in her vocation, but he knew that her
      salary alone had never supplied the costume or the rings, and his
      heart ached.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night he sat at the Duchess of Huddersfield's table facing
      his <i>fiance</i>, and for the first time he wondered if
      sang-froid or perfect equanimity were all that a man such as
      himself might desire. She was, as Bella had put it, "One of his
      own class&mdash;a lady," which she had never been, poor Bella!
      but he did wonder just a little how much of real heart beat under
      the dainty laces that shrouded Lady Ethel's bosom. He had
      reflected once and not so long ago that that portion of a woman's
      anatomy was superfluous, but he wavered in his belief now. He
      could stake his professional honour, his hopes of
      eternity&mdash;of&mdash;everything&mdash;on the absolute purity
      of this girl; nothing would ever tempt Lady Ethel to swerve ever
      so little from the path of rectitude and decorum. The cold, proud
      patrician face spoke for itself, and yet&mdash;he was in a brown
      study when the voice of his prospective mother-in-law brought him
      out of the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," she said in a significant tone and with a glance full
      of meaning, "now I suppose you young people have lots to talk
      about, and will forgive me if I run away."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the silken draperies swept themselves across the floor and
      the door closed softly upon her Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel lay back in a low, lounging chair with a big ostrich
      feather fan in her hand, and she looked up expectantly into her
      lover's face. There was nothing else for it, and he took the
      plunge valiantly&mdash;and with precisely the correct amount of
      maidenly hesitancy, Lady Ethel named a day for their marriage.
      And then&mdash;somehow there seemed nothing more to be said; each
      sat silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John felt rather than saw his companion yawn behind her fan,
      and realised desperately that he must break the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ethel," he said gently; "I am old compared with yourself, and
      grave and sad even beyond my years; are you sure I can make your
      future happy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with a good deal of surprise, and a frown
      puckered her smooth brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? Why should we wish for rhapsodies and commonplace
      love-making? We can leave all that to the Chloes and Daphnes of a
      by-gone age. It would be boring to the last degree. One must take
      pleasure just as much as sorrow, with a certain amount of
      equanimity. If there is one thing more than another that I hate,
      it is to be ruffled. Emotion of any sort ages a girl so
      terribly."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sword would never wear out the scabbard so far as Lady Ethel
      was concerned! He doubted if she were capable of any great depth
      of feeling. But he did not say now as he would have done a week
      ago&mdash;"So much the better;" he no longer felt that it was
      altogether desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her more scrutinisingly than he had ever done
      before, and for the first time he told himself that the
      beautifully moulded mouth was hard and unloving, and that the
      chin spoke of self-will and an amount of resolution unusual in
      such a young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastened to change the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would like to visit Switzerland or Italy?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I don't care for scenery much, or nature! I like human
      nature best; it is much more interesting, I consider. I should
      prefer Paris or Vienna."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Paris or Vienna let it be, by all means," he hastened to
      reply, and Lady Ethel smiled, well pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mamma," said Sir John's <i>fiance</i> an hour or two later,
      when mother and daughter were alone. "Do you know who Mrs.
      Chetwynd was?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Ethel, it is much better that subject should not be
      discussed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't agree with you. Since I am going to marry John it can
      only be right and proper that I should be made aware of every
      detail connected with his former marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lady Ethel adopted that tone, her mother knew by past
      experience that it was a saving of time and temper to yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only know that she was beneath him in position&mdash;a dancer,
      I believe, and she ran away with someone else. Really
      providential, I consider; it must have been a happy release for
      poor Sir John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was plain Mr. Chetwynd."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but already very popular. It was exceedingly fortunate that
      he did not get his baronetcy earlier, for had he done so, she
      would probably have refused to be faithless."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if he felt her desertion much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The world says not; they had lived unhappily for some time
      before, and the general impression was that he did not care in
      the least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you spoke of her to him when he asked your consent to our
      marriage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Ethel, I did; I referred to it as delicately as possible,
      of course. I believe I said, 'your early misfortune,' or
      something to that effect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did he say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he spoke very nicely; he said he was aware that it added
      to the disparity between a man in his position and my daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I replied that because a bad woman had caused him
      misery and suffering in the past, it was no reason why he should
      not win and hold the love of a good girl, and that because of the
      sorrow he had endured, I felt the more assured in trusting my
      child's happiness into his keeping."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was sweet of you, mother; but did it not occur to you that
      there was just&mdash;a little risk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think that John is a man who would forget easily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens, child! what do you mean? you cannot doubt the
      sincerity of his protestations of affection for you, surely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her daughter laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly do not wish him to be more demonstrative, mother
      dear; love-making is the most boring process imaginable; but
      still, I should prefer, I must confess, that there was no
      under-current of feeling for wife number one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You amaze me, Ethel, by suggesting such a horrible idea. The
      woman may be dead for anything I know; at all events, she left
      England before he obtained his divorce, and no one has heard
      anything of her since. It is extremely improbable that she will
      ever return to this country."
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this, as we know, the Duchess was in grave error.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that very moment Bella was sitting by the open piano in her
      cosy apartments in a street off the Strand, idly striking a note
      here and there and humming the air of a new song; but her cough,
      which was incessant, made singing almost out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I'm getting worse," she cried, rising and flinging
      herself on the sofa, "I'm sure I was not so bad as this three
      months ago&mdash;not so bad when&mdash;he never came. Ah! why
      should he? How could I expect it? Perhaps to-day may have been
      his wedding day! Come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened noisily, and Saidie Blackall, very much
      over-dressed and distinctly rouged and made up, entered, followed
      by Mr. and Mrs. Doss, looking precisely the same as on that
      memorable night when they had been the innocent cause of so much
      trouble to Bella's husband. The old music-hall singer and his
      wife had lost no time in looking her up when she returned from
      the States, and were really well-meaning, kindly folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Bella, you look done up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am," admitted the girl wearily. "It was as much as I could do
      to pull through to-night, and I have got a beastly new song to
      tackle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like your cough, my dear," said Mrs. Doss, looking
      distressed; "it shakes you to bits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got a little more cold, I fancy; but I'll be all right in a
      day or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not looking the thing&mdash;I saw you from the front
      to-night&mdash;and&mdash;well, I guess it was a bit of a heffort
      to sing at all, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella turned quickly and looked sharply into Mr. Doss's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you have got anything disagreeable to say, don't be afraid,
      out with it. I suppose you have jumped to the notion that I'm
      dying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to laugh, but it was a piteous attempt, and ended in a
      fit of coughing which left her white and trembling in every limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there!" cried Mrs. Doss, compassionately; "you must not
      excite yourself; we will do the talking, and you keep quiet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella lay back on her cushions, weak and exhausted, and when the
      Dosses at length went away she gave a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did they come for to-night?" she said thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Bella, Doss had heard a bit of bad news and thought it as
      well to put you on your guard; but finding you like this put it
      out of his head, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bad news? What do you mean? He's not married, is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Saidie stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that I know of&mdash;why, he would have you to-morrow; you
      know that as well as I do! you are treating him in a rough way;
      there's no mistake about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella fell back again relievedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you're talking about Charlie, are you?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who should I be talking about? There isn't no one else as wants
      to make an honest woman of you, is there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The shaft fell short of its mark. Bella did not even wince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it strikes me, my girl, you'll have to fall in with his
      views," Saidie continued presently; "for if what has come to
      Doss's ears is true, you'll be out of a berth before you can say
      Christopher Columbus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on earth do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The management are getting dissatisfied, and we know what that
      means."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pale face flushed poppy red.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They can't help themselves," she said eagerly. "I have a
      contract for six months. They cannot cancel it, you must know
      they can't, and it's not very likely I shall allow myself to be
      played fast and loose with as the fancy takes them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if you're not able to fulfil your share of the
      contract&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who says I am not?" cried Bella fiercely. "Old Robertson is a
      fool, and if he thinks I'm going to put up with any hanky-panky,
      he's jolly well mistaken. Let him try it on, that's all! I should
      immediately take steps to enforce my rights, the law is on my
      side, that's clear enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know! You heard what Doss said&mdash;about how you
      looked from the front; and others have got their eyesight as well
      as him, and can see you are not well and not&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not fit to sing&mdash;that's what you are driving at?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Saidie was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you I will sing. Nothing and no one shall stop me. I
      shall just defy them all, and go on, and there's no law in
      England to stop me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you are not a goose, Bella, I never saw one! What in all the
      world keeps you on the boards, I cannot see. Here's a man come
      over from N'York with the intention of marrying you; a man who is
      earning his hundred dollars a week, and you turn up your nose at
      him. I can't understand you. You seemed proud enough of him a
      week or two back; but now all on a sudden, for no earthly reason,
      you show him the cold shoulder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose I can please myself," answered Bella, and her lip
      quivered, and the tears began to roll down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to God I had never left&mdash;Jack," she said weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Saidie gave her what she was pleased to call a "piece
      of her mind" as to the insane folly of any such speech, the
      result of which was that Bella wept and coughed herself into a
      state of collapse, and had to be carried off to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things did not mend. Bella persisted, ill though she was, in
      appearing night after night in public until at length what Saidie
      had predicted came to pass, and she received a formal notice
      cancelling her engagement at the Empire on the ground of the
      extreme delicacy of her health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Doss happened to be with her at the time she
      received the notice, and Bella partially appealed to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will help me, won't you? You won't allow them to impose upon
      me so shamefully. They have no right to do it. It's
      infamous&mdash;'annul my engagement' indeed! They shall find out
      who they are dealing with. It would be ruin for me, it would
      simply spoil my career. I shall go down at once and see
      Robertson. It's a likely thing that I'm going to sit down calmly
      and quietly and accept my dismissal. Not if I know it. I'll give
      Robertson beans."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't do it if I were you," said Mrs. Doss quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not do it; what do you mean? You must be dreaming. It is the
      only thing to be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Mr. Doss, obeying a pathetic glance of his better half,
      put in his oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be a bit patient; wait and see how things turn out; don't do
      anything in a 'urry&mdash;that's our advice&mdash;the old gal's
      and mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, take things heasy, I say," chimed in the "Rabbit Queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see what there is to wait for. Show me what is to be
      gained by waiting, and I will consider it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Bella; Doss here will tell you what we was thinking of; he
      puts things clear like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was in our mind was to talk the thing over first. Allus
      talk the matter well over, was my motto as a boy. It saves a peck
      o' bother and a deal o' doing. Don't flare out about it, but take
      it gently and conversational."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fussing over things won't make you no better," echoed Mrs. Doss.
      "Lor', bless me, didn't I have a sister what killed herself
      fussing! Fussed herself into the grave, she did! And might have
      been here, leastways in Camberwell&mdash;alive and hearty at this
      minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The question is&mdash;am I too ill to fulfil my engagement? and
      I say 'no,'" cried Bella, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And me, the missis and me&mdash;we says, certainly you are, and
      so heverybody says. You want a thorough rest, and then you will
      pick up again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may be your opinion; it is not mine! you may talk till
      doomsday; you won't convince me. I may surely be allowed to be
      the best judge of my own state of health. I shall not wait a
      day&mdash;not an hour. I'm going at once down to Robertson to
      have the matter out with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The distressed pair exchanged glances, and then Mrs. Doss said in
      a coaxing way, "If you must go, you will let me come with you, my
      dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you're on my side and mean to stick up for me, all right; but
      if you're going to hum and haw and look grave, and take the part
      of the management, you had best stay away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doss tucked Bella's arm within her own and trotted upstairs
      to the bedroom, where Bella arrayed herself in total silence, and
      her friend, beyond a vigorous sigh or two, was mute also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robertson was disengaged, and the ladies were at once ushered
      into his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then," began Bella, dashing into her subject, "I have come
      to know what all this means. You cannot dismiss me at a moment's
      notice, and you know it just as well as I do. Ain't you satisfied
      with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly. It is no question of that sort&mdash;but in your
      present state of health you are not up to your work, and there
      was no other alternative."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Bella disagreeably, "does anybody else say I am not up
      to work except you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Miss Blackall, I regret that this has been necessary. I
      am exceedingly sorry that we brought you over from America and
      then are compelled to terminate your engagement so soon, but in
      your present condition&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robertson flung out his hands with an eloquent gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, look here; I'll give up my dance&mdash;that does shake me
      a bit, I'll grant; but you must let me sing the new
      song&mdash;you really must; I'm a nailer at it and I'll wrap up!
      My cough will soon go: give me another chance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her cheeks were flushed with excitement and her eyes were
      sparkling&mdash;she really did not look so very ill this morning;
      perhaps after all, things had been exaggerated. Mr. Robertson
      wavered. Bella was quick to see her advantage and to press it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Withdraw your notice," she said, "and let me come on for one
      song only for a week or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would really be better, I think, if you were to have an
      entire rest for a month or so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, for someone else to step into my shoes! Thank you for
      nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will pay you a fortnight's salary in lieu of longer notice;
      and if you are desirous of returning to your friends in the
      States, perhaps something might be arranged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no friends here or there," said Bella simply; "my
      profession is all I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, we'll give it a week's trial. If at the end of that
      time you are sufficiently recovered to do your work properly,
      well and good; but if not, you must really consider your
      engagement at an end."
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time Mrs. Doss had said nothing. Bella had talked so
      volubly and so fast, there had really been no chance of getting
      in a word; and when the manager rose to his feet to intimate that
      the interview was at an end, there was nothing to be done but to
      follow Bella out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" she cried triumphantly, "I told you I would bring him to
      his senses. You saw how soon he caved in. It is not a question of
      my health at all; you may bet your bottom dollar I have an enemy,
      but I flatter myself I've routed him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her breath was coming in gasps and she spoke with difficulty. Now
      that the excitement was over and the necessity for bearing up at
      an end, there came the reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I had better go home and lie down," she said, "or I
      shall not be at my post to-night, and I must, you know, I must."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor child, I could fairly have cried," said kindly Mrs. Doss to
      her spouse after Bella had been safely escorted home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not satisfied with you, old girl," said Mr. Doss, shaking
      his head mournfully. "I can't 'elp thinking you might ha' managed
      things better. If Bella Blackall goes on a singing at the
      Hempire, you mark my words, she'll sing herself into 'eaven."
    </p>

      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week went by slowly: the hours crept like snails, and yet the
      days were surely slipping away, bringing nearer and nearer the
      one which was to give Sir John Chetwynd his second wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly seen Lady Ethel since the evening when she had
      yielded a coy assent to his not (it must be confessed) very
      amorous request that she would fix an early day for their
      nuptials, and his state of mind was anything but an enviable one.
      If ever a man was torn two ways, halting between prudence and
      worldly consideration on one side and the force and power of a
      love which he had honestly believed was laid for ever in its
      grave, that man was Sir John. The idea of seeing Bella again did
      not occur to him for some days, but when it fastened on him he
      could not shake it off. It was stronger than himself. He excused
      his temptation by the condition of her health, though in his
      heart of hearts he knew well enough that this was not
      sufficiently critical to serve for a reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice he seized his hat with the intention of going to her, then
      laid it aside, angry and disgusted with his own weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His profession no longer occupied his thoughts to the exclusion
      of every other topic. He sat for hours buried in the newly
      awakened memories that that one brief glimpse of her had conjured
      up, unable, unwilling to rouse himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he made a compromise with his own weakness and
      irresolution. He would not go to Cecil Street, since by so doing
      he would be offering a tacit insult to the woman he had pledged
      himself to marry, but he would, he must see Bella, himself unseen
      and his presence unsuspected, and this he could effect easily by
      going to the Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notion pleased him, and that self-same evening he carried it
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella was worse. She could no longer deceive herself. It was only
      by a superhuman effort that she could pull herself together
      sufficiently to sing the one song which was all her part
      consisted of now.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had got into her pretty sea-green skirts of lace and
      tulle and shimmering silk, like so much sea foam, she had to lie
      still and, let the poor over-strained lungs and heart recover
      themselves, and then, when the summons came she called up a smile
      to her wan face and pluckily did her best.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that night she looked up at Saidie after the last ribbon was
      in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have to throw up the sponge, after all," she said wearily;
      "it is beyond me. They are right and I was wrong,&mdash;I must
      have a rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Saidie muttered something in reply, but when the door closed upon
      her sister, she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She <i>is</i> bad; there is no denying it," remarked the
      dresser, who was busily stroking out the roses which were to
      garland Saidie's dress. "It gives me a turn every time I see her
      go on the stage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She looks worse than she really is," returned Saidie; "sometimes
      she is as brisk and lively as you like&mdash;she so soon gets
      tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is a tidy sight worse than 'tired,' and it strikes me her
      voice was weak like to-night. Did you notice it, Miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, she varies so. I guess she would be as right as any of us
      the moment she was on the boards."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, although she was not going to confess it, Saidie
      was troubled and uneasy. There was something in Bella's face she
      had not seen before, and it frightened her&mdash;a little. She
      stood at the wings with a quick-beating heart, but the next
      moment laughed at her own fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella was singing her very best. Not a falter in the clear,
      bell-like tones, and her face was smiling and radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then&mdash;her eyes fastened themselves on a box in the grand
      tier; with a scared expression she shrank back a little, and her
      lip quivered, but with a mighty effort she controlled herself and
      caught up the refrain again&mdash;carolled a word or two,
      faltered, swayed helplessly, uncertainly forward, and fell
      headlong on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were round her in a second, lifting her gently and tenderly.
      Her head had fallen back and a thin stream of blood was welling
      over the laces at her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is dead!" cried Saidie. "Oh, will someone fetch a doctor,
      quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But almost before the words were spoken he was there, and when
      Bella opened her eyes they fell on the grave, anxious, kindly
      face of the man whose wife she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack! Jack! is this&mdash;the end?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush&mdash;no&mdash;no! Keep still&mdash;perfectly
      still&mdash;you must not move."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not&mdash;in pain&mdash;a little dizzy&mdash;nothing more,
      and my head feels light."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink this and don't talk. As soon as you are a little recovered
      we will go home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Home! Jack!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the wistful look in the deep blue eyes&mdash;the prophetic
      droop about the perfect mouth! It was almost more than he could
      bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go with you myself if you will do what I tell you, keep
      absolutely quiet&mdash;your life depends upon it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care&mdash;a&mdash;cent <i>now</i>," she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bore the journey to Cecil Street better than they could hope,
      and the bleeding from the lungs had ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Downstairs Saidie expressed a wish to remain all night with her
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She ought not to be left," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most decidedly she must not be left," replied Sir John&mdash;"I
      intend remaining with your sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You! Well, this beats all, upon my word!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So great was Miss Blackall's surprise that when she found herself
      ousted from the position of head nurse and the door
      metaphorically closed upon her, she had not a word to say, but
      called a hansom and had herself driven to Bayswater, where she
      had been living since her mother's death, now nearly a year ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I used to think he didn't amount to a row of pins," she
      murmured with an odd sort of penitence. "Well, I guess I was
      wrong, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the long hours of that never-ending night John Chetwynd
      watched by Bella's bedside. For the most part, she lay mute and
      inert, but towards morning she grew restless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must talk," she cried excitedly&mdash;"to see you sit there
      and to think&mdash;to remember&mdash;oh! if only I had run
      straight, Jack&mdash;I don't think I was meant for this, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no words with which to answer her. He folded his arms
      across his chest and looked out vaguely into the slant of room
      beyond. The folding doors were open and on the sideboard he could
      see a basket full of peaches, at this season an extravagance
      denied his own table. On the mantelshelf to his right hand were
      some exquisite hot-house flowers, carelessly crushed into a
      cracked, cheap little vase, and a penny packet of stationery and
      a powder puff in a sprinkling of chalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stretched out her arms so that her fingers touched him, and
      he held them tightly in his own&mdash;rings and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was never meant for the life she had chosen!
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart felt breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delicate features, the sweet, wistful, childish face, the
      pathos in her regretful cry&mdash;the past with its load of gall
      and shame and misery&mdash;which could never be obliterated.
      Never!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you look at me like that? I am better. I know I am
      better. I thought&mdash;I feared&mdash;I was going to die; if I
      had there was no one to care but&mdash;Saidie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not think what it would mean to&mdash;me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The words broke from him against his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To&mdash;you, Jack! then you care&mdash;still!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Care!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew his hand away and walked over to the window. The morning
      was breaking: morning in the Strand; and already there was a busy
      hum without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes followed him wistfully, with a little wonderment in
      them&mdash;and then the lids fell over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel strangely weak&mdash;but&mdash;so&mdash;happy, Jack," she
      said. Her breath came more easily and she slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John Chetwynd was in his accustomed place at the accustomed
      hour, grave, attentive and professional as was his wont; but
      after his consulting hours were over, he went back to Cecil
      Street, leaving word with Soames where he was to be found, if
      wanted, prepared for another night's vigil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She seems neither better nor worse," said Saidie, meeting him in
      the little sitting-room and carefully pulling to the door behind
      her. "She is very, very weak. Is there a chance for her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid to say&mdash;it depends so much on what recuperative
      power she has. If the bleeding can be stopped, I shall be more
      hopeful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is she to do, poor Bella? She will never be able to sing
      again, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never." He spoke curtly, almost cruelly. Saidie burst into
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment came a smart tap at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Bolingbroke, Miss," said a voice from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can't come up." Saidie sprang from her chair. But she was too
      late. The handle turned, and a tall, distinctly good-looking man
      walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Blackhall&mdash;how unkind to deny me admittance. You must
      know how fearfully anxious I am. How is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's the doctor&mdash;ask him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger turned eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is not serious, I trust. She was always delicate,
      but&mdash;it is wonderful how she pulls together when the worst
      is over."
    </p>
    <p>
      For almost the first time in his life John Chetwynd was
      tongue-tied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who and what was this man, and what was he to Bella? He forced
      himself to give a professional opinion, and answered mechanically
      a string of questions Mr. Bolingbroke poured forth, but he hardly
      knew what he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If only she gets over this she shall never be bothered any more,
      poor darling," he said brokenly. "I suppose I can go in, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand was on the door&mdash;John Chetwynd sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one must see her," he cried excitedly. "I absolutely forbid
      it. It would be most dangerous&mdash;most improper."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked into each other's faces for the space of
      several seconds; then Mr. Bolingbroke turned away with a sigh and
      an impatient word. "Absurd! As if I could do her any harm," he
      said. "Well, I will be round again later in the day," he added
      with a nod to Saidie, and a minute later the hall door shut upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that man?" asked Sir John sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saidie shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall tell me&mdash;what is he to Bella?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a good and noble man, and let me tell you there ain't too
      many knocking around. If she lives to get over this he will make
      her his wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was silence&mdash;a silence in which John Chetwynd read
      clearly his own heart at last, and stood face to face with
      facts&mdash;facts stripped of false adornments&mdash;naked,
      convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he strode across the room and entered that in which Bella
      lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was asleep, and he drew his chair close to the bedside and
      fixed his eyes on the wan, thin face, fever flushed, and fought
      the fiercest battle of his life with his inner self; and when the
      struggle was over, Pride lay in tatters and Love was conqueror.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slept at intervals almost the whole of that day. Waking late
      in the afternoon, her eyes fell on the silent watcher by her
      side, and she smiled happily, contentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saidie bent over her and whispered a word or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;no," cried Bella vehemently; "send him away. I don't
      want to see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he is so anxious, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he?&mdash;poor Charlie! Tell him I am in no pain, and I
      should like to think he will never quite forget me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will never do that," said Saidie, going away with her message
      but half satisfied, and Bella turned a flushed cheek to her
      pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, for the second time, John Chetwynd asked, "Who is that
      man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Bella tried feebly to tell him. He had been attached to her
      for a long time, and had come over with her from the States.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you&mdash;did you mean to marry him, Bella?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had thought of it&mdash;it seemed suicidal to say no to such
      an offer, and then I&mdash;oh, Jack, when I saw you I knew I
      could never love any other man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He poured out a draught and held it to her trembling lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel so strangely weak," she said; "you are going to marry
      Ethel, and I am nothing to you now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John Chetwynd drew her close to him, so that the tired head
      rested on his shoulder with the sweet familiarity of long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen," he said. "I have been a coward, frightened of the
      truth. The world was dearer to me than happiness, or I thought
      so, and I hesitated, afraid of its contempt. But amid my weakness
      was one thought, one impulse, which no amount of worldly prudence
      or consideration could stifle, and Bella&mdash;my wife&mdash;that
      was my love for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack, Jack, is it true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have loved you always, through all my life, you and no other.
      I see now how hard I must have seemed to you and how wild and
      unreasonable I was in my expectation from you and how at last it
      drove you from my side. The shame of it is not more yours than
      mine. We both erred, we both sinned; but I was older and should
      have been wiser; the burden of it should fall on me. The world is
      nothing to me now&mdash;less than nothing. Let us take up life
      where we broke it off. Give me back the past, which held for me
      all of happiness I have ever known."
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay with a smile of peace upon her face, both hands clinging
      to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have communed with myself and thought it well out, and I
      believe that to bind my life, with its memories of you, to the
      girl to whom I am engaged, would be a cruel wrong and an
      injustice to her. She deserves a better fate, and I honestly feel
      that the rupture will not grieve her much. We will remarry, you
      and I. I will take you away from England, I will guard and
      cherish you, and in my love for you, you will grow stronger. Oh!
      my darling, my darling, if you knew what life has been to me
      since you went; how I have blamed myself,&mdash;I who ought to
      have shielded you against yourself, and have been a moral
      backbone to your weakness. Then as time went on I persuaded
      myself that I had succeeded in putting you out of my
      heart,&mdash;that I had forgotten you,&mdash;and then&mdash;you
      came back to me, and the past leapt living from the years that
      had no power to bury it, and I knew that you were more to me than
      honour or fame or anything the world held. Hence-forth I will be
      so gentle with you, so tender&mdash;so loving."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you&mdash;kiss me&mdash;Jack?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had gradually pulled herself upright on the pillows.
    </p>

      Their lips met and clung together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless you&mdash;wifie."
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was silence, a long silence, broken by a gasp, a sigh,
      and a gentle unloosening of the clasping arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bella&mdash;Bella&mdash;speak to me, my beloved."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the passionate cry fell on ears that heard not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tempest-tossed soul was at rest; above were the pitying
      Angels' wings, and over all the solemn hush of Death.

    <p>
      Dearest Amy,
    </p>
    <p>
      Here am I on Jack's yacht, anchored in Southampton waters. The
      weather is perfect, and I am having a very good time. Jack's
      mother is on board, and is really devoted to me. I am a lucky
      girl to have such a sweet mother-in-law in prospective. She is
      the dearest old lady in the world. The wedding has been decided
      upon for the last week in September, so I suppose that I shall
      have to come back to town before very long to see about my
      trousseau.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is really nothing so bewildering to anyone who sees it for
      the first time as the exquisite order and dainty perfection of a
      yacht in which its owner takes a pride, and can afford to gratify
      his whim. And this is the case with Jack. The deck shines like
      polished parquet. The sails and ropes are faultlessly clean, and
      Jack says that the masts have just been scraped and the funnel
      repainted. The brass nails and the binnacle are as perfectly in
      order as if they were costly instruments in an optician's window.
      There is a small deck cargo of coal in white canvas sacks, with
      leather straps and handles. And there is the deck-house with its
      plate-glass windows and velvet fittings and spring-blinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after I arrived I went down into the engine-room, where I
      saw machinery as scrupulously clean as if it were part of some
      gigantic watch which a grain of dust might throw out of gear. On
      the deck are delightful P. and O. lounges with their arms doing
      duty for small tables. All around the wheel and upon the roof of
      the deck-house, and here and there on stands against the
      bulwarks, there are ranged in pots, bright red geraniums
      contrasted with the yellow calceolaria, and the deliriously
      scented heliotrope. Altogether, everything is charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      We go delightful trips every day, and it doesn't matter whether
      there is a favourable wind or not, as Jack's is a steam yacht. We
      have slept on board except one night when it was rather rough,
      and then Mrs. Vivian and I stayed at the South Western Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether I am enjoying myself more than I have ever done in my
      life. Jack is an angel and adores me, the darling.

    <p>
      P.S.&mdash;There is a Mrs. Tenterden, a widow, coming down to the
      yacht on Thursday to stay for a few days. Mrs. Vivian tells me
      that she is very good-looking.

    <p>
      Dearest Amy,
    </p>
    <p>
      We are still here. Mrs. Tenterden, the lady I spoke about in my
      last letter, arrived here on Thursday.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hate her! I hate her!! I hate her!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      You will doubtless wonder why I, who am, as a rule, a quiet,
      harmless little dove, should indulge in such sinful feelings, but
      you will cease doing so when I tell you the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tenterden has set her cap at Jack! He has&mdash;I know
      it&mdash;fallen under the spell of the enchantress. And she is an
      enchantress. She is a woman of about thirty, tall, fair, with
      striking features, lovely eyes, and the most superb complexion I
      have ever seen. The best complexion I ever recollect was that of
      a peasant girl's at Ivy Bridge in Devonshire, but hers was
      nothing to compare with Mrs. Tenterden's. It is perfect. I can
      say no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she is extremely amusing, being a brilliant talker (for I
      heard Jack say so) and very witty (for he is constantly laughing
      at the things she says, and which for the most part I don't
      understand).
    </p>
    <p>
      But this I know, that since her advent I have changed from the
      happiest girl in the world into one of the most miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tenterden is the widow of Colonel Tenterden, who was a
      brother officer of Jack's father, Colonel Vivian. Her husband
      died in India about six months ago, and she has lately returned
      to England. Jack had never seen her before, but Mrs. Vivian, who
      knew her as a young girl, asked her down here.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has made a dead set at Jack, and I feel (I can't help it)
      that he has fallen a captive to her bow and spear, for his manner
      towards me has entirely changed. He is not my darling, loving
      Jack, at all, but merely a polite friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vivian must be blind not to see what is going on. But I
      cannot enlighten her, and what am I to do? Do give me your
      advice, dear Amy?

      My dearest Child,

    <p>
      Just got yours. You ask my advice, and to use a phrase of my
      brother Tom's, "I give it you in once." Don't be a little goose
      and bother your pretty little head. I am older than you, and I
      understand women of the Mrs. Tenterden type. They amuse men for a
      time, and very often take them captive, but in nineteen cases out
      of twenty the prisoner escapes. In other words, they are not the
      women who men care to marry. Fancy your Jack, for instance,
      preferring a <i>ruse</i> garrison hack, like Mrs. Tenterden, to
      your own sweet self. It is absolutely ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do nothing and say nothing. Don't worry yourself and all will
      come right. The temporary infatuation will pass away, and Mr.
      Vivian will love you all the better afterwards. You will see if I
      am not right.

      DEAREST LILY,
    </p>
    <p>
      I promised to let you know how I got on, and to write as soon as
      there was anything to write about. So here goes. I am on board
      Jack Vivian's yacht, and a ripper it is. That is to say, I am on
      the yacht in the day, but sleep at the South Western Hotel. I
      hate sleeping on board a yacht, and never do so if I can help it.
      It may benefit one's health&mdash;daresay that it does&mdash;but
      I do like to take my rest on shore. Well, now, as to my news. I
      have made a great impression on Mr. Vivian. He is the easiest man
      to deal with I ever met in my life, and he is as putty in my
      hands. That stupid girl, Miss Dacre, to whom he is supposed to be
      engaged&mdash;I say supposed because he does not seem to be quite
      clear about it himself&mdash;hasn't got a chance with me. What
      Jack Vivian could have ever seen in her I can't guess. She is the
      usual type of English Miss who can say "Papa and Mamma," and that
      is about all. I can see that she loathes me, and I don't wonder
      at it. But I am perfectly charming to her, and affect not to
      notice her palpable dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vivian&mdash;Jack's mother&mdash;seems not to have the
      remotest idea how matters are shaping, and fondly imagines that
      her beloved son is going to marry Miss Dacre. My dear Lily, as
      the Americans say, "it will be a cold day in August before that
      event comes off." The fact is that Jack pays her only the
      slightest attention and is absolutely engrossed with me. If I,
      therefore, don't pull off this <i>coup</i> I deserve to be
      hanged. When I have actually landed my fish I shall take my
      departure for a day while he breaks matters off with
      mademoiselle. You may not perhaps approve of this, but I know
      what I am about.

      DEAREST ALICE,

    <p>
      I was much interested in your letter. Needless to say that I wish
      you the success that you are sure to attain. One word of advice.
      If I were you, while you are at Southampton, I should manage to
      be a good deal more at the hotel than you appear to be. You
      cannot have much opportunity for conversation on board the yacht,
      but at the hotel you can have Mr. Vivian all to yourself. And you
      can easily make excuses to get off the yacht, and as he is
      evidently so <i>pris</i>, he will follow you to the hotel, when
      you will have him more or less at your mercy. I shall be longing
      to hear how the plot thickens.
    </p>
    <p class="quotsig">

      DEAREST LILY,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks for yours. My dear child, I have taken your excellent
      advice and am very glad that I did so. Your plan of campaign has
      proved most successful. I have had Jack with me for hours in the
      smoking room at the hotel, where the ladies staying in the hotel
      as well as the men always resort. It is a large room and affords
      ample opportunity for a <i>tte--tte</i>. Of these
      opportunities I have availed myself to the fullest possible
      extent. And with what result, you will naturally ask? With the
      result, my dear, of making this man absolutely mad about me. He
      has become an utter imbecile. <i>C'est tout dit</i>. His
      incoherent raving would only bore you, so, like the kindhearted
      little person I am, I spare you this infliction. Suffice it to
      say that he is mine body and soul. I say nothing about his
      fortune, because that naturally goes with the other two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me thank you sincerely for your wise counsels,

    <p>
      DEAREST AMY,
    </p>
    <p>
      Pray forgive me for not having written sooner. But as the French
      say, <i>tout savoir est tout pardonner.</i> And having been for
      many days in the depth of despair, worried out of my life, and
      half dead with anxiety, I have not really been able to put pen to
      paper. But now all is changed, and I am able to address you with
      a light heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sure, Amy, that you will be longing to know why, and for
      this reason I will not for a moment leave you a victim to the
      most terrible ailment that can attack our sex&mdash;unsatisfied
      feminine curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days ago we were still at Southampton, and it was proposed
      that after lunch we should take a little trip down the river
      Hamble&mdash;a river which runs into Southampton Water. Well, we
      started&mdash;Jack, and a friend of his, Captain Cleland, Mrs.
      Vivian, Mrs. Tenterden, and myself. All went well for about an
      hour, when a breeze sprang up which soon developed into half a
      gale. At least I understood the captain of the yacht to say so. I
      didn't mind it in the least, but Mrs. Vivian, poor old lady, was
      dreadfully ill and nervous, and though I did all I could to
      comfort and reassure her, it was not of much use. As for Mrs.
      Tenterden, she absolutely collapsed. In abject terror she uttered
      incoherent cries, and no one could make out what she wished to be
      done. Jack seemed very upset and tried to soothe her as well as
      he could, but it was all to no effect, and indeed she once turned
      on him just like a virago, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never wanted to come on your horrid yacht, but you would make
      me, and see what has happened to me now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Jack&mdash;I call him "Poor Jack" although he has behaved
      like a very naughty boy&mdash;seemed to wince, but made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually we arrived opposite the village of Hamble, and there
      the anchor was weighed&mdash;if that is the right expression.
      Jack suggested that the three ladies, including myself, should go
      ashore in the dingey and stay at the hotel. Mrs. Vivian said that
      she did not want to do this, and Mrs. Tenterden positively
      refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think that I am going to risk my life that jim-crack
      boat?" she asked. "I am not quite an imbecile. Though I think I
      must be after all, otherwise I should not have come on this
      idiotic cruise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack again made no reply, but there was something in his face
      that told me that he was becoming disillusioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after that he sent the skipper and a boy ashore, who
      returned with some marvellous looking lobsters and a huge crab.
      It seems that this place is famous for its shell-fish, and I can
      only say that I never tasted anything more delicious than the
      crab in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vivian managed to eat a little dinner, but Mrs. Tenterden
      retired to her cabin and contented herself with some soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      I for my part, ate a most capital dinner, and I fancied that Jack
      seemed sorry for the way he has been treating me lately;
      treatment which I should never have put up with, except from a
      man whom I love so devotedly&mdash;a man whom I meant to rescue
      (selfishly, I admit) from that siren's clutches. In all I have
      done I have been guided by your advice, and therefore to you
      remains all the credit, coupled with the life-long devotion of
      your little friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we slept on board the yacht, and the morning brought its
      revelations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tenterden was not present at breakfast, and came on deck
      very late. And only imagine, my dear, how she had changed. That
      beautiful pink complexion that I had admired so much, and even
      envied, had disappeared altogether. Her face was of a greyish
      hue, and possessed no shade of pink. Those beautiful pencilled
      eyebrows seemed to have strangely altered, and to have
      unaccountably thinned down. The charming woman-of-the-world
      manner had entirely disappeared, and, later on, when we descended
      to the cabin, at luncheon time, Mrs. Tenterden cast furtive and
      certainly not reassuring glances at the little mirror hanging
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I confess that at first I was a wee bit sorry for her, but after
      all, this Nemesis was thoroughly deserved, and when I saw the
      impression that the metamorphosis had made on Jack&mdash;the
      darling goose can't conceal his feelings&mdash;I must own to
      having been overjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Enchantress" left for London the same evening, looking in
      her war paint quite a different being. But this made no
      difference, for Jack, I need scarcely say, had evidently altered
      his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since her departure, everything has gone back to its old state.
      Jack, poor fickle boy, is devotion itself, and I have not thought
      proper to resist his entreaties to consent to an immediate
      marriage. You will not blame me, darling, will you?

      INVENTED.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "You're a very foolish man, John," said my sister Ruth. "You're
      worse than foolish. A man never gets any happiness by marrying
      out of his station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be right," I answered, "but after all I have something
      to offer. I am rich, and Marie is poor. I admit that she is a
      patrician and that I am a plebeian. But money, after all, counts
      for something, especially in these days. I don't see how Marie
      can spend a very happy existence now, but I am determined to make
      her life a dream of happiness. You will see, my dear Ruth, that
      my marriage will be a success."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not," replied my sister, "and I therefore give you my
      warning before it is too late. If you don't heed it and decide on
      marrying Miss Dalmayne, I shall naturally do any little thing in
      my power to endeavour to prove that I have been a false
      prophetess; but, mark my words, John, I shan't succeed. And, to
      tell you the truth, my dear brother, I tremble for the future."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a sweet little silly goose," I answered. "You let your
      affection for me run away with your better judgment. Why in
      heaven's name should I not be happy with Marie? She is beautiful,
      and I admit that it was her rare beauty that first commended her
      to me, and she has a sweet nature and character; and after all,
      goodness of character outweighs even good looks. Then, too, she
      is very clever and bright, and altogether she is exactly the sort
      of girl calculated to make a man happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope that I may be wrong, and that you may be right, John,"
      said Ruth; "but I don't think that I am wrong, and, of course,
      time will only show. At present we need say no more. Your mind is
      evidently made up, and I shall urge nothing further to prevent
      you from following your own inclinations. But in the time to
      come, don't forget that your sister warned you." And with that
      last shaft Ruth left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      My name is John Gardner, my age is thirty-six, and I am what is
      generally known as "a self-made man." But had I really had the
      making of myself I should have endeavoured to produce a different
      being. I recollect at the grammar school in Cambridgeshire, where
      I received a plain education, hearing one of the masters, Mr.
      Ruddock, mention a Greek proverb, "Know thyself," and advise the
      boys in his form to act upon the advice given by the Greek sage
      who pronounced these words. I was not, as a rule, struck with
      much that fell from Mr. Ruddock's lips, for he was a dull,
      stupid, and pompous man, possessing much more force of manner
      than of character. But I did take this advice to heart and
      endeavoured to act up to it, with the result that I know as much
      about my own uninteresting self as most other human beings know
      about themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, this is how I appear in my own eyes. A strong, healthy man
      with an active disposition, and capable of, and a lover of hard
      work. A blunt manner, and with an entire absence of tact in
      anything in which strict business is not concerned. I know that I
      am truthful, for, in addition to a natural hatred of lying which
      I must have inherited from my dear parents, I have always
      recognised the fact that in business and in everything else the
      truth always pays the best. During the sixteen years that I have
      devoted to business I have endeavoured to act squarely and fairly
      with everyone with whom I have been brought in contact, and I may
      say without conceit that I have earned a good name in addition to
      the three hundred thousand pounds that I have been able to save.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never got on particularly well with the other sex, partly,
      I suppose, from my manners, which, to say the least, are not
      attractive, and partly to the fact that up to the time I met
      Marie Dalmayne I have never cared for a woman. I came across the
      girl that I have grown to love so well in this fashion. I am
      interested in a West Australian mine to the extent of about a
      hundred thousand pounds, and am one of the three partners who
      control the concern. One of them is a member of the great City
      house of Bleichopsheim, and the other is Mr. Ross, a wealthy
      iron-master. It was at the latter's house in St. James's Square
      that I met my fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took Miss Dalmayne down to dinner, and I think that my heart
      went out to her from the first. I found her clever and sensible,
      and with apparently little of the frivolity which characterises
      most of the young women with whom I have been brought in contact.
      Her conversation, if not absolutely brilliant, was at any rate
      bright and amusing, and possessed a considerable amount of
      shrewdness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Dalmayne was about twenty-three, tall and fair,' possessing
      a perfect figure and the most beautiful and expressive hazel
      eyes. Her hair was nut brown with a warm reddish sun-kissed
      glint, and her features were regular and aristocratic. Her smile
      was delightful. In short, I fell in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I ascertained from Adam Ross full particulars in
      reference to Miss Dalmayne. She is the only daughter of the
      Honourable George Dalmayne, and is related to many of the highest
      English families. Mr. Dalmayne and his wife are not well off, and
      the former is very much in debt and has taxed the generosity of
      my friend Ross to a very considerable extent. The Dalmaynes live
      in a small house in Eaton Terrace. They have only one other
      child, and that is a son who is in the Army and is at present
      with his regiment in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some people that one feels one can confide in in
      matters of a delicate nature, and there are others to whom one
      could never open one's mouth. Now, Ross and I have been friends
      for ten years, during which time we have never had the least
      difference. He is a man absolutely to be trusted. I told him
      during this interview what a deep impression Miss Dalmayne had
      made upon me. He said that he did not in the least wonder at it,
      for she was greatly admired, and added that if it were not for
      her father she would no doubt have made a brilliant marriage
      already. I told my friend that I cared nothing about her father,
      that I was not marrying him but his daughter&mdash;that is to
      say, if I were fortunate enough to induce her to become my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think that there is much fear of a failure," answered
      Ross, "old Dalmayne is looking out for a rich husband for Marie.
      Indeed, in a confidential mood one day recently he told me almost
      as much himself. And he is not likely in a hurry to find one so
      rich as yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I shall call upon him to-morrow," said I, "and ask his
      permission to speak to his daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you every success, my dear friend," said Ross, "and I
      have no doubt as to the result of your interview. And I don't see
      why you should not be very happy. After all, as you say, you are
      not marrying the father. You are marrying Marie, who is a very
      high-principled girl, who is beautiful, who is accomplished, and
      who would, I am certain, do everything to make her husband
      happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was settled, and next morning I called on Mr. Dalmayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dalmayne, a tall, aristocratic man of about sixty, received
      me with great cordiality. Whether Ross, who had dined with him on
      the previous night, had mentioned anything of my matter to him I
      don't know, but the old gentleman did not seem to be the least
      surprised when I told him what the object of my visit was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Dalmayne," said I, "you will doubtless be wondering why I
      have called to see you"&mdash;Mr. Dalmayne's face assumed a
      sphinx-like expression&mdash;I will not keep you waiting for an
      explanation. The truth is that I have fallen in love with your
      daughter. Our mutual friend Adam Ross can tell you all about me,
      and I don't think that his report would be an unfavourable one.
      My position is this. I have saved three hundred thousand pounds,
      which produces an income of about twelve thousand a year. And I
      am making at least another twenty thousand a year from my share
      of our mine and other sound enterprises. Should you permit me to
      address Miss Dalmayne, and should I be happy and fortunate enough
      to induce her to become my wife, I should propose to settle two
      hundred thousand pounds upon her for her exclusive use."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your proposals are most generous," said Mr. Dalmayne, "and do
      you credit. But in matters of this kind I should never dream of
      attempting to control my daughter. You have, however, my full
      permission to speak to her, and if she is willing to marry you,
      you both have my full consent. My wife shares my views entirely.
      Marie is out with her mother at the present moment, but she will
      be in all the afternoon, and if you will call about four I will
      see that you have the opportunity for which you are seeking."
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked Mr. Dalmayne most cordially and promised to return in
      the afternoon. When I again arrived at Eaton Terrace I was shown
      into the drawing-room, where I found Mrs. and Miss Dalmayne and a
      sister of Mrs. Dalmayne's. Tea was brought in, and shortly
      afterwards the visitor took her departure. A few minutes later
      Mrs. Dalmayne made some excuse for leaving the room, and I was
      left alone with Marie. My heart had beaten hard from excitement
      as I had knocked at the door, but strange to say I felt no
      nervousness now. I plunged into the matter that brought me
      without delay. I told Miss Dalmayne of the wonderful effect
      produced upon me by her beauty and charm, and in the fewest words
      possible I asked her to be my wife, promising that she would
      never repent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have done me a great honour," said Miss Dalmayne, "but I
      must have a little time to think over what you have said and to
      consult my parents. You shall hear from me at latest the day
      after tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      I shortly afterwards took my leave, and departed buoyed up by the
      strong hope that the desire of my heart would be obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was I disappointed. On the day she had promised I received a
      letter from Miss Dalmayne saying that she was willing to accept
      me, but frankly confessing that she had no love for me as yet,
      though admitting that she liked me. "If," she continued, "you are
      willing to take me on this understanding, I am ready to be your
      wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      Needless to say I was willing to accept these terms, and three
      months afterwards we were man and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the month of July that we were married, and we went to
      Aix-les-Bains for the honeymoon. A few days previously Mr.
      Dalmayne asked me to lend him a thousand pounds, which I did
      cheerfully, for after what my friend Ross had told me I was fully
      prepared for such a request.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife had never been to Aix before, and seemed to amuse herself
      very much. She played a little at the tables, and with a
      considerable amount of success. I must admit that she was very
      kind to me, and though of course I easily saw that I did not at
      present possess her real affection, I was not discontented, and
      hoped for the time to come when we should be all in all to each
      other. We had met very few acquaintances at Aix, for it was not a
      good season as far as English visitors were concerned, owing to
      attacks on our country and Government by the French papers. But
      when we had been there about three weeks a Captain Morland came
      upon the scene. Captain Morland, who was an officer in the
      Grenadier Guards, had known my wife since she was a child. They
      seemed very pleased to see each other again, but there was a
      certain sadness that I noticed in the young officer's manner. He
      had just been invalided home from South Africa, where he had been
      on active service during the time with which my narrative deals.
      He was a handsome young man, tall and well built, and with kind
      and expressive blue eyes. He was singularly reticent as to his
      exploits during the war, though I heard from a friend of his who
      was with him at Aix that he had been mentioned in despatches and
      had been recommended for the D.S.O. He was a man to whom the
      merest chance acquaintance was certain to take a fancy. I am
      bound to say that I did so myself, and I hope that in what I am
      calmly relating I shall not be considered to have intentionally
      failed to do him justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the second week in August, and as the weather was very
      hot, my wife and I had determined to leave Aix and go to
      Trouville for a little sea air and bathing. Three days before our
      departure I returned to the hotel to dress for dinner. I was just
      going through the corridor when I heard voices in our
      sitting-room. They were the voices of my wife and Captain
      Morland.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't think that I am naturally a mean man, but I was mean
      enough to listen on this occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mustn't blame me, Hubert," said my wife, "we were all on the
      verge of ruin, and I was bound to marry him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could you consent to do such a thing? You don't care for him
      in the least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said my wife; "nor shall I ever do so if I live for fifty
      years. I care for no one but you. But I shall always do my duty
      to my husband, who is a kind and good man and lives entirely for
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he died, you would marry me?" asked Captain Morland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I would, and, as the children's storybooks say, 'live
      happily ever afterwards.' But don't let us discuss deplorable
      futurities."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was enough for me. I saw, now that it was too late, how wise
      my sister Ruth had been, and how foolishly I had acted. There was
      nothing to be done, however, to remedy matters, in view of the
      words spoken by my wife, and words which breathed of truth. I
      went out quietly into the garden of the hotel and came back a few
      minutes later. I asked Captain Morland to dine with us, and he
      accepted my invitation. I carefully watched him and my wife
      during the evening, and clearly saw that the case was hopeless
      from my point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow I made my will, and left everything to my wife with
      the exception of fifty thousand pounds for my sister Ruth. I then
      wrote the little history of my mistake, and am posting it from
      the top of Mont Revard to my friend Ross, and have asked him to
      act as he thinks best. It is hard to die, but, in my position, it
      is still harder to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having set my entire affections in one direction, and having been
      hopelessly unsuccessful, there is only one thing to be done, and
      that is to end matters. And I shall end them to-night.

      Extract from an Aix-les-Bains newspaper:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The body of a rich Englishman, named Gardner, who was staying at
      the Hotel de l'Europe, was found lying at the bottom of the
      precipice between Aix and Mont Revard. It is, of course, pure
      conjecture how the unfortunate gentleman met his fate, but no
      foul play is suspected, as his money and valuables were found
      upon his body. We anxiously await developments. The police are
      maintaining a strict reserve."

      left no doubt what their relations had been. I tore it up before
      his face; and for a time, excepting for the girlish illusions he
      had shattered, that was an end of the matter.

      You may well say so. She was sitting on a table drinking brandy

      for a picture he was going to work on&mdash;and, I don't know,
      perhaps it was true. Still considering what had been, her
      presence there was an outrage, and I shall never forget the
      quarrel there was between Charles and me. That was the last I
      have seen of Rosaline&mdash;she went flying.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
